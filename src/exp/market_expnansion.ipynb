These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage.

These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market.

In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application.\\nAccess Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955\\nCOVID-19 scenario Analysis:\\n* The growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\n* Flexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus.\\n* As the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market\\n* Many organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market.\\nTop impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis\\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market.\\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\nGet sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320\\nGrowth in need for PaaS\\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market.\\nDependency on vendor is a major concern:\\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market.\\nInquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320\\nKey benefits of the report:\\n* This study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\n* The report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\n* The current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\n* Porter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers & suppliers in the market.\\n* The report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years.\\nRegions Covered\\n* North America (U.S. and Canada)\\n* Europe (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\n* Asia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\n* LAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\nCompanies Covered\\n* Microsoft Corp.\\n* Google LLC.\\n* Amazon Web Services Inc.\\n* Salesforce.

In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market.

These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage.

Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage.

The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market.

       "      \"Case Studies\\nIntellectual property (IP) valuation for upcoming fuel cell Technology\\nWe were engaged by a US based company for advice on the potential acquisition of certain IP assets in the fuel cell domain.\\nWe analyzed the technological, legal, market, strategic and financial aspects associated with the monetization potential of the technology. This included a detailed portfolio analysis to screen and classify over 2000 patents as well as an in-depth patent cluster valuation.\\nOur recommendations helped the client to determine the right price for the technology and risk factors that could adversely impact the value.\\nSetting up a supply chain from scratch in emerging markets\\nA global industrials company, keen to extend its manufacturing footprint into emerging markets, engaged Aranca to evaluate the possibility of sourcing complex components locally in Asia and South America.\\nAranca managed the entire RFX process and benchmarked suppliers on their technical capabilities and pricing. We developed detailed ‘should-cost models’ for different components to help assess the cost-benefits and impact on product pricing.\\nOur in-depth analysis helped the client to quickly develop a GTM plan for local sourcing with potential savings of nearly $7M by Year 3.\\nR&amp;D roadmap in the area of displays\\nA leading materials manufacturer engaged Aranca to analyze future trends in display technology and recommend suitable R&amp;D strategies.\\nAranca analyzed the spectrum of next generation displays (e.g. Quantum Dots, Haptic, Self-healing) to identify the most promising technologies from a growth standpoint. A detailed technical analysis was done to identify areas where the client already had existing products and gaps that would require capability building through organic/inorganic route.\\nThe analysis helped the client in developing a R&amp;D roadmap for providing specific core layers in displays.\\nFinancial advisory for $500 million car dealership transaction in GCC\\nThe client approached Aranca seeking financial and transaction advisory services for its car dealership business.\\nAranca created a dynamic business plan and valuation model encompassing all operational drivers of the company as well as its distinctive financing requirements. Aranca integrated the market factors, competitive forces as well as consumer needs and preferences into the plan driving the valuation, thereby empowering the client with a scenario-based, highly dynamic model for deal negotiations.\\nCo-sourced credit research services for a global bank\\nA team of 10 dedicated Aranca credit analysts serve as an exclusive research partner for a global Bank’s proprietary and sell-side fixed-income trading desk.\\nAranca support includes asset classes like high yield, leveraged loans and special situations across Europe, the US and emerging markets including Asia. Our team is closely integrated with the client’s onshore team and acts as a virtual extension of client’s team with frequent visits to client offices.\\nInternational Expansion: Market Assessment and GTM Strategy\\nA US medical devices company with a diversified product portfolio, engaged Aranca to evaluate various emerging markets and recommend a global expansion strategy.\\nWe adopted a phased approach for the study covering a quick market scan, deep-dive market studies in 11 countries and a detailed GTM strategy for four countries. Our ability to find the right data points and qualitative insights through extensive on-the-ground research helped the Client to quickly initiate action plans for market entry, including a distributor acquisition for one of the markets.\\nHot assets valuation for an intricate transaction involving seven sister companies\\nAranca was commissioned to value hot assets associated with the target company that had receivables from sister companies, as a result of a complex inter-company payment structure.\\nWe identified individual hot assets, separated the payments for each structure amongst different companies, assigned probabilities, and further discounted the cash flows with an appropriate risk-driven discount rate. Adjustments were made to eliminate the impact of the parent company’s financing activities to arrive at the valuation for tax reporting.\\nOffshore research and product management platform for a GCC bank\\nAranca’s suite of deliverables include daily research notes, thematic notes, initiation coverage/maintenance and market mapping pitch-books.\\nOur team serves as a direct extension of the in-house team and this has helped the client to save substantial annual costs, while also solving the challenge of hiring quality talent locally. Further, Aranca leveraged its global experience to advice the Client on compliance and regulatory procedures, including setting up Chinese walls between the Asset Management and IB divisions at the Bank.\\nIncreasing market share through customer intelligence\\nA leading construction equipment manufacturer, looking to boost sales in key markets, engaged Aranca to undertake in-depth analysis of end-user preferences, factors influencing buying, and competitor benchmarking.\\nThe study entailed extensive qualitative discussions with end-users across segments in six countries on the above parameters.

In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market.\\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\nGet sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320\\nGrowth in need for PaaS\\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market.\\nDependency on vendor is a major concern:\\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market.\\nInquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320\\nKey benefits of the report:\\n* This study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\n* The report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\n* The current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\n* Porter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers & suppliers in the market.\\n* The report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years.\\nRegions Covered\\n* North America (U.S. and Canada)\\n* Europe (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\n* Asia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\n* LAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\nCompanies Covered\\n* Microsoft Corp.\\n* Google LLC.\\n* Amazon Web Services Inc.\\n* Salesforce.

       "    'Initially it was thought that Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality would be limited to the gaming industry, however, when big firms opened up to the different ways of using it Augmented Reality is used to indicate sponsors and show scoreboards in various sports while viewed from the television or the Internet. Some companies have been trialing music concerts of bands like Coldplay, AC/DC and Imagine Dragons. The idea is to make the virtual reality experience better than actually being there.   What is Augmented Reality &amp; Virtual Reality?  Augmented Reality is an “enhanced” version of reality created using technology to add images, information or both into the environment. Virtual Reality is a form of simulated environment created with computer technology. Although similar in concepts, Augmented Reality has been in use for some time, especially in the sports industry.   What are the applications of Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality in the Entertainment Industry?  The entertainment industry consists of various subsets such as the film industry, the live events industry, sports, gaming, theme parks/ amusement parks. Each of these subsets could find different ways to integrate Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality. For example, in the live events industry, people in Delhi could view a concert taking place in Hyderabad. Perhaps, they could download a replay and view it at their own time. It doesn’t have to be a concert, it could be a play, an opera or even a comedy show. The technology is currently being applied to allow users to immerse themselves in various games and sporting events. It has also been a staple in the news, especially the weather where graphics are displayed on television to indicate the climate.   Market Research &amp; Market Trends:    NextVR becomes the exclusive VR provider for NBA:  Die-hard fans who miss games due to unforeseen circumstances will no longer have to stick to highlights. NextVR is a major provider of music, sport and entertainment experiences and appears to have landed a mega-deal. In the future, more companies will sought out lucrative deals to be the sole provider of VR content for various events in the entertainment sector.  A new Virtual Reality theme park opens in Seoul:  South Korea, home to one of the first VR theme parks, has another VR theme park, and the company plans to add more parks in the year. This signals the growing acceptance of VR in theme parks, which are also cost-effective when compared to actual parks, and they don’t require a lot of physical effort to change the overall theme for events such as festivals and   BBC Virtual Reality app downloaded over 325k times:  The application which provides VR content for the World Cup such as the match highlights, a live statistics dashboard, and match commentary has been downloaded a record number of times. Although, when compared to non-VR content, the readings make for poor performance. It is still a significant improvement. As more and more electronics are built to be more efficient and effective in handling VR content, the number of applications in the market will increase.  Japan gets VR movie viewing:  Vaio, a subsidiary of Sony, is testing VR movie screening with test audiences who will sit through the movie with people putting their VR headset throughout the movie.  However, in some countries, 3-D movies are undergoing diminishing returns, as people are no longer interested in wearing glasses. Upcoming players in the entertainment industry should make note of this development and how they could combat it.     Who are the key players in the Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality in Entertainment?  The key players in the Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality Entertainment Industry are NextVR, Sony, Verizon, Magic Leap, and various other companies.  What is our report scope?

Tokyo\\nJapan\\nrd Akihiko SHIRAI GREE VR Studio Laboratory REALITY, Inc. Tokyo\\nJapan\\nAvatar Fusion Karaoke: Research and development on multi-user music play VR experience in the metaverse 1 st Alexandre BERTHAULT\\nIndex Terms-MetaverseVRKaraokeAvatarReal-time\\nThis paper contributes to building a standard process of research and development (R&D) for new user experiences (UX) in metaverse services. We tested this R&D process on a new UX proof of concept (PoC) for Meta Quest head-mounted display (HMDs) consisting of a school-life karaoke experience with the hypothesis that it is possible to design the avatars with only the necessary functions and rendering costs. The school life metaverse is a relevant subject for discovering issues and problems in this type of simultaneous connection. To qualitatively evaluate the potential of a multi-person metaverse experience, this study investigated subjects where each avatar requires expressive skills. While avatar play experiences feature artistic expressions, such as dancing, playing musical instruments, and drawing, and these can be used to evaluate their operability and expressive capabilities qualitatively, the Quest's tracking capabilities are insufficient for full-body performance and graphical art expression. Considering such hardware limitations, this study evaluated the Quest, focusing primarily on UX simplicity using AI Fusion techniques and expressiveness in instrumental scenes played by approximately four avatars. To achieve our PoC, we first researched the limitations and challenges of such applications. In Meta Quest 1 and Meta Quest 2, the benchmark for simultaneous avatar rendering was 10 for Quest 1 and 22 for the Quest 2. The appropriate interpersonal distance (IPD) should be designed with culture in mind. We assume that various avatars communicate at a maximum distance of 1-2 meters while generating collisions for individual avatars and avoiding overlap. Considering the interference in stereophonic sound, we consider that 5-11 avatars can be displayed simultaneously while maintaining quality communication. Through our standard R&D process, we assessed the production needs for our PoC and obtained multiple ways to retrieve feedback. A notable effect was observed when other users entered the same session. When users waved and called out to one another (saluted), their participation time increased by 3 minutes (i.e., they played more than one piece of music). Most users did not perceive the AI-only piano-playing avatar as human (i.e., they perceived it as a non-player character [NPC] in the game). This research reported methods for multiuser metaverse communication and its supporting technologies, such as head-mounted devices and their graphics performance, special interaction techniques, and complementary tools and the importance of PoC development, its evaluation, and its iterations. The result is remarkable for further research; these expressive technologies in a multi-user context are directly related to the quality of communication within the metaverse and the value of the user-generated content (UGC) produced there.\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nA. Context and motivation\\nThe importance of the simultaneity of 3D space and UGC is mentioned in the modern definition of the metaverse (Matthiu Ball) [Bal22]. The underlying motivation for this study was based on the idea that we need to create an atavistic experience in existing or future HMD devices from the avatar-driven social networking service (SNS) that is expanding on smartphones today. People have many expectations and fantasies about the metaverse; therefore, it must first be defined and scoped. A 3D-avatar social networking service, the metaverse has been the focus of much attention in recent years, with ZEPETO, REALITY, and other services growing rapidly. Assuming an inevitable future when extended reality (XR) devices, such as HMDs and augumented reality (AR) glasses are widely adopted by current smartphone users, various related topics will require research. In addition to human-computer interaction (HCI) research using current virtual reality ready devices, such as PCs and stand-alone HMDs, R&D will be needed on the avatar UX that contemporary, casual smartphone users would naturally find attractive as an extended-reality social network service (XRSNS).\\nB. Avatar expression and related works\\nThe user avatar is another crucial subject. Users such as VTubers and non-fungible token (NFT) artists employ varied identities as avatars; avatars are also used as Virtual Beings in distributor culture and as icons on many\",\n",

However, the academic discussion of the Metaverse still mainly focused on the technical system design, and few research studied Metaverse challenges from the perspective of consumers, i.e., Metaverse users. One difficulty is that the analysis from the consumer's perspective requires interdisciplinary theoretical framework and quantifiable Quality of Experience (QoE) measurements. In this article, pioneering from consumers' point of view, we explore an interaction between Metaverse system design and consumer behaviors. Specifically, we rethink QoE and propose an framework that encompasses both the Metaverse service providers (MSPs) and consumer considerations. From the macro perspective, we introduce a joint optimization scheme that simultaneously considers the Metaverse system design, consumers' utility, and profitability of the MSPs. From the micro perspective, we advocate the Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) as an easy-to-implement measurement for future Metaverse system studies. To illustrate the usability of the proposed integrated framework, a use case, i.e., virtual traveling, is presented. We show that our framework can benefit the MSPs in offering competitive and economical service design to consumers while maximizing the profit.Index Terms-Metaverse, quality of experience, consumer behavior, interdisciplinary research\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nS UPPORTED by the development of communication technologies, the Metaverse is an emerging concept considered to be the next generation of the Internet. Instead of accessing the Internet through mobile phones and computers, users can completely immerse themselves in the virtual world of the Metaverse through interactive technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). In addition, Metaverse can provide support for the construction of the real world. For example, complex experiments that are difficult to be performed in the real world can be simulated in the Metaverse, and then the results are fed back to the real world for decision-making. These desirable features have drawn the attention of giant multinational companies globally. For instance, Facebook, which recently changed its name to Meta, H. Du and D.

Microsoft acquired company Activision Blizzard, Inc. for $70 billion to support its Metaverse strategy.\\nTo exploit the full potential of the Metaverse, several system design indicators have been proposed and widely adopted, e.g., high-reliability feedback, high-definition virtual object perception, and feeling of immersion. Both the industry and academia have made numerous efforts to improve the performance based on the proposed indicators. For example, the development of computational graphic software such as Unreal Engine has made it possible to render scenes that are close to places of interest in the real world. In addition, advances in hardware, such as head-mounted devices (HMDs), can provide users with high-quality virtual scene perception over long periods of time to create an immersive experience in the Metaverse. Meanwhile, it is foreseeable that Extended Reality (XR) devices in the near future can further improve the quality of immersion. Massive data transmission can be efficiently supported by advances in communication technologies, e.g., massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technology, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, mmWave, and semantic communication techniques.

       "    \"Home \\n Press Release \\nGlobal Digital Human Avatar Market\\n Digital Human Avatar Market Size Worth USD 561.16 Billion in 2032 \\n \\n Increasing effort by customer-centric companies is a major factor driving global digital human avatar market revenue growth \\n  Market Size – USD 29.51 Billion in 2022, Market Growth – at a CAGR of 34.2%, Market Trends – Growing media &amp; entertainment industry  \\n Vancouver, B.C., July 21, 2023  - The global digital human avatar market size is expected to reach USD 561.16 Billion in 2032 and register a revenue CAGR of 34.2% during the forecast period, according to the latest analysis by Emergen Research. Growing media &amp; entertainment industry can be attributed with the steady market revenue growth. With the rapid growth of media and entertainment industry, digital human usage is projected to increase, which is expected to drive revenue growth of the digital human avatar market over the forecast period. For instance, on January 2023, ColorDigital, a German company, has partnered with its digital platform DMIx to introduce a collection of customizable virtual avatars. The primary objective behind this launch is to promote an end-to-end digital workflow for fashion brands. In collaboration with Verce, ColorDigital has developed two products: DMIx StudioAvatars and DMIx 3D-Studio. These products aim to facilitate sustainable production practices while also advocating for diversity and representation within fashion industry. By leveraging these virtual avatars, fashion brands can streamline their workflows and contribute to more sustainable and inclusive practices.\\nThe market revenue growth is expected to be restrained by a lack of understanding about the benefits of digital human avatars. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) gains traction in the business sector, many firms are looking for areas where technologies such as machine learning and deep learning can provide a competitive advantage. Customer service automation is one of the most promising use cases; in recent years, numerous businesses have created avatars that can assist organizations in relieving burden on their customer care workers and engaging with customers at scale. However, some people are skeptical of AI, and it can be difficult to get customers comfortable with the idea of connecting with new technology, especially if they feel obligated to speak with an impersonal application interface when they will be communicating with a human.   \\n \\n Some Key Highlights From the Report \\nOn 9 March 2023, Pantheon Lab, an AI startup based in Hong Kong, believes that AI-generated digital human avatars have the potential to be valuable in various industries, not only in Hong Kong but also beyond. This comes as there is growing public interest in advanced AI services, such as ChatGPT, that offer sophisticated conversational capabilities. Pantheon Lab aims to tap into this trend and offer AI-generated avatars to traditional industries, leveraging the potential of advanced AI technologies.\\nThe interactive digital human avatar segment is expected to account for largest revenue share in the global market over the forecast period owing to companies working on various Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities, product launches, and making innovations in existing product lines. For example, on July 5, 2023, NTT DATA announced imminent release of their ShotView technology, which would be backed by digital twin technology. ShotView incorporates millions of data points from the course in an interactive context to provide unmatched insights into the live golfing experience. NTT DATA will also present its latest AI-powered digital human platform, Lottie, at the event. Lottie will act as an educational and amusing guide for visitors, providing information about the event, participants, and sport itself, as well as guiding spectators with course navigation. NTT DATA's digital human platform adds a human touch to the standard self-service interface by employing a lifelike digital avatar that duplicates human movement, sound, gestures, body language, facial emotions, and tone of voice.\\nThe entertainment segment is expected to account for largest revenue share in the global market over the forecast period. Digital human avatars provide entertainment makers unprecedented creative freedom and control. To meet their creative vision, filmmakers and animators can modify and fine-tune the look, behavior, and narrative arcs of these avatars. This adaptability enables the study of varied storytelling styles, character development, and imaginative worlds that would be difficult or costly to accomplish using traditional methods. Artists, animators, and performers can collaborate remotely using digital human avatars, allowing them to work from separate places. This worldwide accessibility dissolves geographical barriers and promotes cross-cultural partnerships, resulting in different and enhanced narrative experiences. In the entertainment industry, digital human avatars provide unique prospects for longer audience connection and commercialization. Fans can interact with their favorite characters through virtual experiences, virtual meet-and-greets, and virtual meet-and-greets.\\nThe digital human avatar market in North America accounted for largest revenue share in 2022. Factors such as increasing activities by leading market players, such as new releases and product expansions, among others, are driving revenue growth of the market in this region. Ogilvy, for example, launched Reality, a specialized digital experience ‘lab’ geared at investigating and creating novel uses of technology such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Dickon Laws, Ogilvy's global head of innovation, will lead the studio, which will serve as a ‘innovation translator, pathfinder, and risk navigator’ for network customers.

This project aims to provide an accessible entry point to the immersive Metaverse experience by leveraging web technologies. The platform developed allows users to engage with rendered avatars using only a web browser, microphone, and webcam. By employing the WebGL and MediaPipe face tracking AI model from Google, the application generates real-time 3D face meshes for users. It uses a client-to-client streaming cluster to establish a connection, and clients negotiate SRTP protocol through WebRTC for direct data streaming. Additionally, the project addresses backend challenges through an architecture that is serverless, distributive, auto-scaling, highly resilient, and secure. The platform offers a scalable, hardware-free solution for users to experience a near-immersive Metaverse, with the potential for future integration with game server clusters. This project provides an important step toward a more inclusive Metaverse accessible to a wider audience.\\nSubjects: Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) ; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)\\nCite as: arXiv:2304.01443 [cs.HC]\\n(or arXiv:2304.01443v1 [cs.HC] for this version)\\nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.01443\\nFocus to learn more\\narXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\\nSubmission history\\nFrom: Joseph Chang [view email]\\n[v1] Tue, 4 Apr 2023 01:34:23 UTC (4,979 KB)\\nFull-text links:\\nDownload:\\nDownload a PDF of the paper titled Virtual Avatar Stream: a cost-down approach to the Metaverse experience, by Joseph Chang\\n* PDF\\n* Other formats\\nCurrent browse context:\\ncs.HC\\nnew | recent | 2304\\nChange to browse by:\\ncs\\ncs.CV\\ncs.NI\\nReferences & Citations\\n* NASA ADS\\n* Google Scholar\\n* Semantic Scholar\\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\\nBibTeX formatted citation\\n×\\nloading...\\nData provided by:\\nBookmark\\nBibliographic Tools\\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\\nLitmaps Toggle\\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\\nscite.ai Toggle\\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\\nCode, Data, Media\\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\\nDagsHub Toggle\\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\\nLinks to Code Toggle\\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\\nScienceCast Toggle\\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\\nDemos\\nDemos\\nReplicate Toggle\\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\\nSpaces Toggle\\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\\nRelated Papers\\nRecommenders and Search Tools\\nLink to Influence Flower\\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\\nConnected Papers Toggle\\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\\nCore recommender toggle\\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\\nAbout arXivLabs\\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

NVEs aim to give distributed users a feeling of immersion in a virtual world and the possibility of interacting with other users or with virtual objects inside it, like when they interact in the real world. Being able to provide that feeling and natural interactions when the users are geographically separated is one of the goals of these systems. Nevertheless, this goal is especially sensitive to different issues, such as different connections with heterogeneous throughput or different network latencies, which can lead to consistency and synchronization problems and, thus, to a worsening of the users' quality of experience or QoE. With the purpose of solving these issues, researchers have proposed and evaluated numerous technical solutions, in fields like network architectures, data distribution and filtering, resource balancing, computing models, predictive modeling and synchronization in NVEs. This paper gathers and classifies them, summarizing their advantages and disadvantages, using a new way of classification. With the current increase of the number of NVEs and the multiple solutions proposed so far, this work aims to become a useful tool and a starting point not only for future researchers in this field but also for those who are new in NVEs development, in which guaranteeing a good users' QoE is essential.\\nDiamond Park [42], Virtual Real Meeting [43], Mozilla Hubs [44], CAVRN [45], Decentraland [46], VRChat [47], and Bigscreen [48] are some few examples.\\nTo interact in an immersive way within the NVEs, users usually employ an avatar 1, which is a virtual representation of themselves inside the VE, controlled by one or more input devices (e.g., a mouse, keyboard, joystick, gamepad or haptic) connected to their computers [1], [49]. Furthermore, by giving feedback (e.g., through sensorial effects, such as sounds, vibration, pressure, wind, or aromas) to the events within the virtual world, the users' feeling of immersion is highly improved. Moreover, for visualizing the 3D environments, traditional screens, and Cave Assisted Virtual Environments (CAVEs) [50] can be employed, but nowadays head-mounted displays (HMDs) are gaining momentum, as they are becoming more affordable and are the ones which really provide users with a complete feeling of immersion. Figure 1 shows an overview of the involved structure of a simple NVE with two remote users (A and B) controlling their avatars that can interact with the objects in the VE and between them. Before exploring NVEs in deep, it is important to know the base elements that define a VE and how they work. Then the paper will focus on Networked VEs.\\nIn general, VEs comprise both hardware (HW) and software (SW) parts. The former part usually includes computers (with processing units, storage mediums…), displays (normal displays or embedded in HMD), and input/output devices; while the latter mainly consists of digital databases (DBs), media data, operating systems (OS), file systems, and application programs.\\nOn the one hand, some elements in the HW part (e.g., computers) allow to run the SW of the VE and to interact with other HW elements (e.g., input/output devices). The required elements depend on the purpose and complexity of each VE. For instance, a simple 2D computer-based game would just need a computer, a screen, and a keyboard, while an immersive one (e.g., a VR game) may additionally involve a head-mounted\"]},\n",

       "   'search_results': [\"Home       \\n ICT        \\n Gaming As A Service Market \\n Gaming As A Service Market Size, Share, Opportunities, COVID-19 Impact, And Trends By Platform (PCs And Laptops, Smartphones And Tablets, Gaming Consoles), By Technology (File Streaming, Video Streaming), And By Geography - Forecasts From 2022 To 2027\\n \\n  Published :  Sep 2022\\n  Report Code :  KSI061611080 \\n  Pages :  130 \\nDescription\\nTable Of Contents\\nCompanies Profiled\\n The global Gaming as a Service (GaaS) market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 38.77% to reach a value of US$18.407 billion by 2027, up from US$1.858 billion in 2020. The increasing number of gamers globally is the major factor behind the growing demand for gaming as a service market.\\nThe growing number of smartphone users coupled with rising internet penetration is supporting the market growth of gaming as a service. An upsurge in competitive gaming on mobile devices, laptops, and consoles, along with increasing expenditure required to customize and upgrade the assembled PCs and gaming laptops in order to play upcoming games, is also contributing to the escalating demand for gaming as a service. Gamers are increasingly demanding advanced hardware requirements to experience the best graphics, refresh rate, and FPS (frames per second) settings. This is encouraging gamers to switch their preferences to other solutions such as gaming as a service (GaaS), thereby, augmenting the market growth.\\nHowever, the presence of the substitute, that is, traditional gaming on PCs or consoles in which the game needs to be purchased, downloaded, and updated, is restraining the market growth of gaming as a service. Furthermore, the unavailability of proper infrastructure to provide good internet connection strength and internet speed in some of the developing and emerging economies is another factor that is hampering the growth of this market.\\nThe commercialization of 5G provides a great opportunity for the growth of gaming as a service market during the next five years. In addition, supportive government initiatives to boost the adoption of 5G in emerging economies are also encouraging market players to boost their market share, thereby positively impacting market growth. For example, the Government of India has formed a High-Level 5G India 2020 Forum with the Ministry/Department of Telecom and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). The goals of this forum are to facilitate the early deployment of 5G in India, which would, in turn, help improve the connection strength and speed, allowing for better and unfettered access to gaming as a service (GaaS).\\nFurthermore, the key players in the market are involved in collaborations and launching enhanced services in order to boost their market share and contribute to the growth of the market. For example, recently in February 2020, NVIDIA announced the public launch of its cloud gaming/gaming as a service solution. This service provided by NVIDIA is able to run demanding games and is backward compatible, which means that it is able to access data from the previous versions also. Also, in December 2019, the company announced it had entered into a collaboration with Tencent to bring gaming as a service to China. The “START” is gaming as a service product by Tencent, powered by a GPU from NVIDIA, which makes the availability of AAA (Triple-A titles, those that are produced by prominent game producers) games on underpowered solutions for the users and games possible. In addition, in November 2019, Google announced the launch of its new gaming service, “Google Stadia”. Gaming as a service and game streaming product can beam any high-end console and PC games to the Chrome browser, Chromecast dongle, or Pixel 3 smartphone and was launched in select countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, and much of Europe. The gaming as a service (GaaS) market has been segmented based on platform, technology, and geography. By platform, the market has been segmented as PCs and laptops, smartphones and tablets, and gaming consoles. By technology, the market has been segmented into file streaming and video streaming.\\n The Mobile Phones and Tablets segment holds a significant market share \\nMobile phones and tablets are estimated to hold a significant market share owing to the advanced features such as the good amount of RAM and processors that are loaded into mid-level phones and some entry-level phones, which provide a good and cheap gaming platform. For instance, Xiaomi sells a gaming phone called the Black Shark 2, and ASUS also sells a phone series called the “ROG Phone”.\\n File Streaming to contribute significantly to the market growth over the forecast period \\nFile streaming technology is poised to grow at a decent CAGR during the forecast period. This is due to the fact that the use of this technology enables the streaming of the games easier as by only downloading a small portion of the game, the game is accessible by the players even in low bandwidth and poor internet speed conditions. The market for video streaming technology holds a considerable market share. For video streaming, the game is available on the cloud, and no part of the game needs to be downloaded, although a high bandwidth and high-speed internet connection are required.\\n The North American region to grow at a noteworthy pace over the forecast period \\nGeographically, the global gaming as a service (GaaS) market has been segmented into North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (MEA), and Asia Pacific (APAC). The North American region is projected to hold a significant market share and grow at a noteworthy pace over the forecast period, which is attributable to the fact that in countries such as the US, there are increasing investments in R&amp;D for the improvement and enhancement of capabilities of this service. Players such as Google and Microsoft are leveraging every opportunity to increase the adoption of this next-gen service. The APAC regional market will experience significant market growth on account of the rising popularity of cloud gaming and the rapidly growing gamer population in APAC countries. Countries such as China and South Korea are among the largest online gaming industries in the world, with mobile gaming increasingly popular in Korea. In conjunction, the increasing investments and initiatives being taken by the market players also support the market growth of gaming as a service in this region. For instance, in September 2019, SK Telecom announced that it would be the operating partner under the tech giant Microsoft, in order to deliver a cloud gaming service based on the 5G network called “Project xCloud” in Korea.\\n Key Development: \\n April 2022- Microsoft announced that it would purchase 98% of the shares of Activision Blizzard. This acquisition will benefit Activision Blizzard by strengthening its game industry position and giving its workers access to new prospects.\\n February 2022- Leikir Studio, the creator of Metal Slug Tactics and Rogue Lords, was purchased by Focus Entertainment. The Leikir studio becomes the fifth development studio integrated into the Focus Entertainment firm, validating the multi-production approach.\\n January 2022-The ROG FLOW Z13 tablet was introduced by the gaming division of ASUS, Republic of Gamers (ROG). This tablet has a ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3050 Ti Laptop GPU, an Intel Core i9-12900H processor, and Boost: 13.4-inch WQUXGA (3840 x 2400) 16:10 glossy display, 16GB (8*2 LPDDR5 onboard memory), 1TB M.2 2230 NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD, Dolby Atmos, AI noise-canceling technology, Hi-Res certification, 1085MHz at 40W, 1035MHz Boost Clock+50MHz OC, 35W+5W Dynamic Boost, 3-microphone array and 2-speaker built-in system with Smart Amplifier Technology, and a dedicated MUX Switch that support multiple input types and graphics boost with XG Mobile. ?\\n  Impact of COVID-19 on the  Gaming as a Service Market  \\nCOVID-19 had a positive impact on the market. Many people choose to spend most of their time in their homes due to the preventive precautions the majority of the world's population took against the coronavirus. The unfortunate circumstances made individuals stressed, anxious, and afraid. Additionally, folks were unable to partake in social gatherings or outdoor activities.

Therefore, the availability of high-speed internet is expected to boost the growth of the market during the forecast period. \\nSignificant Market Trends\\nGrowth in mobile cloud gaming is one of the primary trends in the market. As mobile cloud gaming grows in popularity, smartphones, and tablets are becoming more and more popular because it gives players access to high-quality games without the need for powerful devices, giving them more flexibility in terms of when and where they can play games. More and more users are accessing the game. Additionally, these services such as Google Stadia, Microsoft xCloud, and NVIDIA GeForce Now have made it easier for gamers to access games on the go without having to carry around a console or gaming PC.\\nAccording to a Newzoo report, the market is expected to hit USD 98 billion by 2024, and gaming will be the major contributor to this growth. The convenience of being able to play games on the go and the increasing power and performance of mobile devices are the main factors driving this trend.\\nMajor Market Challenge\\n Infrastructural and bandwidth challenges are impeding the market growth. Streaming high-quality games requires a lot of bandwidth. This can be difficult for users with access to limited data plans or slow internet connections.

This market encompasses a vast array of games ranging from top-tier titles to mobile games, offering a comprehensive gaming experience across various platforms such as gaming console, laptop, tablets, and smartphones. The integration of VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality) technologies enhances immersion, attracting gamers to the realm of Cloud gaming. Video games delivered through Remote servers empower users with seamless access, eliminating the need for high-end Gaming hardware and enabling gaming on Smart TVs and Gaming consoles. Startups and established players in the Gaming industry leverage Gaming analytics and innovative Game design to continually refine the gaming experience. This segmentation underscores the diverse facets driving the evolution of cloud gaming, promising an exciting future for gamers and industry stakeholders alike.\\nThe market share growth by the video streaming segment will be significant during the forecast period. Video streaming is a key component of cloud gaming as it allows gamers to access games over the internet without having to download or install them on their local devices. Cloud gaming providers typically use video streaming technology to deliver games to gamers in real-time, allowing them to play high-quality games on a variety of devices, from smartphones to game consoles. \\n   \\n Get a glance at the market contribution of various segments   View the PDF Sample   \\nThe video streaming segment was valued at USD 1.17 billion in 2018. There are several different approaches to video streaming for cloud gaming. A common method is to use a thin client architecture. In this case, the game runs on a remote server and the video is streamed over the Internet to the player\\'s device. In this model, the player\\'s device must be powerful enough to allow video streaming and send input back to the server. This approach is suitable for games with low latency requirements. Another option is to use a more powerful client device that can handle some processing locally. In this model, part of the game runs on the local device and part on the remote server. This reduces latency and improves the overall gaming experience but requires more powerful devices and more complex architectures. In both cases, the video streaming technology used must be able to handle the high bandwidth and low latency demands of cloud gaming. This typically involves adaptive bitrate streaming where video quality is optimized based on the player\\'s internet connection and a specialized protocol designed for low-latency video streaming, such as WebRTC or the Low Latency HLS (LL-HLS) protocol. Overall, moderate growth is expected for the video streaming segment during the forecast period. \\nRegional Analysis\\n   \\n For more insights on the market share of various regions  Download PDF Sample now!   \\n North America is estimated to contribute 50% to the growth of the global market during the forecast period.

       "    'AI NPCs  Last week, a group of Stanford computer science researchers led by Joon Sung Park announced a project called Smallville where 25 AI agents inhabit a virtual world. These agents are completely unaware they are inhabiting a simulated environment and help uncover the complexities and opportunities around multi-agent emergence.Â  At Konvoy, we believe that AI non-playable characters (NPCs) are one of the most compelling opportunities for AI in games, and even in other industries such as sales, defense, and healthcare. Here are three key use cases we are excited about:Â   Emergent gameplay Populating virtual experiences Simulations   Use Case #1: Emergent Gameplay  This use case explores the concept of emergent gameplay through the utilization of expanded knowledge and limited autonomy for NPCs in video games. This has the potential to transform player experiences by introducing greater complexity, unpredictability, and immersion into gaming environments.  Dynamic NPC Knowledge and Immersive Gameplay: The integration of expanded knowledge and limited autonomy into NPCs has the potential to create a dynamic game world that reacts to player actions in more nuanced ways. Unlike traditional NPCs that possess static dialogue and actions, dynamically informed NPCs would evolve alongside player choices. This interactive element could make every playthrough unique and encourage players to explore various strategies and pathways to interact with the game world.  Expanding Player Choice: By giving NPCs a more sophisticated understanding of the player\\'s actions and intentions, emergent gameplay allows for greater freedom of choice. Players can create alliances, build relationships, or even manipulate NPCs based on a dynamic exchange of information. This expands the possibilities for branching narratives and multiple outcomes, enhancing replayability and player agency.  Multi-Layered Player-NPC Interactions: As NPCs\\' reactions are influenced by dynamic knowledge and simulated emotions, the potential for multi-layered interactions between players and NPCs becomes a reality. Players must now consider the potential consequences of their actions more carefully, as NPCs\\' responses become more organic and context-dependent. This introduces an added layer of challenge and depth to the gameplay.  Immersion and Believable Game Worlds: Emergent gameplay through dynamic NPC knowledge allows for the creation of more immersive game worlds. As NPCs evolve alongside player actions, game environments will feel more authentic and realistic, giving players influence on the narrative. This level of immersion can enhance emotional investment, leading to a more engaging and captivating overall gaming experience.  Diverse Gameplay Experiences: In games with expansive open worlds, such as Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption 2, emergent gameplay can offer a nearly endless variety of gameplay experiences. NPCs with dynamic knowledge create a dynamic ecosystem where events can emerge naturally based on player choices. This enriches the player\\'s journey, encouraging experimentation and exploration of different storylines. While emergent gameplay introduces exciting possibilities, it also poses challenges. Balancing dynamic NPC behavior to ensure that it remains challenging and coherent without becoming overwhelming or frustrating is essential. Additionally, maintaining the integrity of the game\\'s narrative while allowing for dynamic interactions will be complex.  Use Case #2: Populating Virtual Experiences to Represent Reality  This use case dives into the idea that the vision of the \"metaverse,\" a shared virtual space where people can interact, work, and socialize, doesn\\'t necessarily require every participant to be a real human player. Instead, the thesis suggests that AI-controlled non-playable characters (NPCs) could play a pivotal role in enhancing the believability and scale of virtual experiences, particularly in situations where technical limitations hinder massive real-player interactions.  Scale and Realism in Virtual Spaces: The concept of a metaverse is often visualized as massive virtual cities, crowded stadiums, and bustling marketplaces, mirroring real-world interactions on an unprecedented scale. However, achieving this level of interaction with real players presents technical challenges, including server capacity, synchronization, and maintaining a consistent quality of experience. AI NPCs can bridge this gap by populating these virtual spaces, creating the illusion of a vibrant environment.  Overcoming Technical Constraints:',\n",
       "    'An (inevitably incomplete) overview of the emerging landscape of artificial intelligence and procedural generation in interactive media\\nLightspeed &amp; GamesBeat present the top 25 startups in gaming. Apply or nominate today!\\nLearn more about our investment in Inworld AI, the leading character engine for AI NPCs.\\nIntelligent worlds and characters — Inworld AI’s “Origins” is a glimpse into the future of AI-driven video games. Players take on the role of a detective in a neo-noir world filled with intelligent non-player characters (NPCs)—and using nothing but microphones and their creativity, players are tasked with questioning witnesses, uncovering the narrative, and cracking the case. (Source: Inworld AI)\\n At Lightspeed, we are believers in the power of gaming as the ultimate online social experience—one where creativity, skill, and collaboration meet to become joy. It’s no wonder why gamers are some of the most engaged and retentive audiences of any consumer vertical.\\nWe’ve seen this first-hand through our gaming investments since 2006—from early wins like Playdom and Snap to recent breakouts like Epic Games, Polygon, and Tripledot Studios. With the share of global gamers continuing to grow, younger demographics choosing games to socialize and learn, and strong technological tailwinds, it’s obvious why we continue to be focused on the industry.\\nThe Infinite Power of Play\\nBut there’s something even bigger to be said about “the infinite power of play.” For half a century, video games have profoundly shaped consumer behavior and acted as a catalyst for significant technological innovation. With the advent of the ‘Metaverse,’ and as an ever-increasing time of our lives is spent in immersive virtual worlds, gaming is expected to continue its pivotal role in how we play, work, and connect.\\nMany life-changing technologies were born in gaming, in part because (1) interactive experiences are often pushing the boundaries of what’s technologically possible and (2) play and innovation are inevitably intertwined: play is “safe exploration,” and work is “exploitation of learned patterns,” not too indifferent of how some of AI works. The best-scaled example of cross-sector breakthroughs that originated in gaming is probably NVIDIA: originally built to perform complex 3D calculations in video games, now our most powerful computational engine and the backbone of all AI, blockchain, and so much more.\\nSeizing Platform Shifts with Novel Experiences—Not Incremental Improvements\\nMany of the past technological and cultural tailwinds felt like incremental building blocks. (By the way, the gaming industry has only seen one “down year” since 1997—in 2022, coming out of an inflated 2020 and 2021 post-COVID influx; 2023 is up again.)\\nIn contrast, the dawn of artificial intelligence and procedural intelligence appears more akin to a platform shift in line with the rise of the consumer internet around the start of the millennium, or the introduction of the mass-market mobile smartphone in 2007.\\nHistorically speaking, in platform shifts like these, generational companies won’t only incrementally improve upon existing workflows with faster, better, or cheaper tools; they will create completely novel, previously impossible user experiences—like intelligent non-player characters (NPCs) and generative agents that go far beyond pre-programmed decision trees and limited narrative choices.\\n Zynga’s rise through mobile, casual gaming modalities and Rovio’s innovations in tactile touchscreen experiences are great examples from the gaming world, where a newcomer capitalized on a new reality of consumer experiences despite the incumbents’ (in this case, Electronic Arts or Activision) perceived resource advantage. A textbook example of corporate inertia and the innovator’s dilemma.\\nAt Lightspeed, we expect the shift to artificial intelligence and procedural generation will be no different. Those unable to deliver these new experiences in their games will be left behind as audiences will continue to prefer the most immersive experiences. Much of what seems like a fever dream today will be considered table stakes in a matter of years—not decades.\\nThe 4th Industrial Revolution of Video Games\\nInevitably, the AI platform shift will accelerate the velocity of game creation in ways that are likely hard to conceive today. This article takes a look at what we call the four industrial revolutions of game design. To set the context, we need a little bit of history.\\n 1) The Publisher Model: Gaming’s Stone Age \\nInnovation in gaming has historically focused on improving the technical aspects of the player experience–better graphics, faster processing, or higher player concurrency–which, while important, often came at the expense of improving the game development process and infrastructure itself.\\nThis “publisher model” borne out of the Hollywood studio system favored monolithic architectures produced in silos divided into three categories: hardware (consoles), software (studios), and marketing (publishers). Companies in each category would do a variety of tasks since the gaming market was small and couldn’t justify companies specializing in each segment of the game development process. With everything from engines to objects built for each game, development required larger and larger teams to deliver novel game experiences. AAA game budgets built in this way ballooned to $100M+, raising the stakes to release high-quality games and leading to a reduction in the number of studios that could release such games.\\nAAA Development Costs Balloon — AAA game development costs continue to grow year-over-year. Most recently court filings leaked that 2020’s The Last of Us Part II had a budget of $220M. (Source: VentureBeat)\\n With such high development costs, executives focused on games for their known core market – mostly teenage boys – and wouldn’t take creative risks on development games for other diverse audiences. Two forces bucked that trend: modularization and UGC.\\n 2) Modularization: Refocusing on Gameplay  \\nMonolith development first began to change with the growth of licensed game engines–first id Software’s Doom and Quake Engines and then Epic Games’ Unreal Engine and Unity. These off-the-shelf engines abstracted the creation of the environments that games lived in and sped up the development process in the industry through strong network effects: developers versed in a popular engine used in one game could easily re-use that knowledge in developing another.\\nThis initial wave of modularization of the game development stack–mostly in the early 2000s–saw the rise of indie game developers as we know them today. Game infrastructure improvements on the development-front like Adobe Flash and GameMaker Studio and the distribution-front like Steam and XBox Live. These tools together allowed smaller developer teams to build games efficiently while still reaching meaningful scale. Creating compelling game mechanics and assets became the focus, rather than developing the low-level systems to power their game environments or searching for a partner to publish their games to offset expanding development budgets. Modularization reduced costs through standardization of the game development stack.\\nWe believe the modular model and further standardization are here to stay as the benefits of modularization extend beyond increasing development speed and agility. By standardizing aspects of game development, we expect an increase in the pace of iteration and a growth in the scope of games per developer, especially in live-service formats.\\nVelocity of Creation and Iteration Will Drive Future Revenues — While the majority of revenues today are concentrated in traditional monolithic architectures (e.g. EA, Activision), increased efficiency in game creation will allow games to be closely tailored to player preferences. Revenue will likewise shift towards studios that iterate and adapt fastest. (Source: Lightspeed)\\n A second-wave of modularization has been underway for the past few years. Companies like Pragma, inspired by the success of engines like Unity and Unreal Engine, are building plug-and-play solutions for complex yet tedious aspects of the game backend including matchmaking, battle passes, and inventory management. Similarly, Hathora provides serverless hosting for multiplayer games so teams have less game launch anxiety. We think it’s critical for solutions to find the right balance between standardization and extensibility to be able to sell into both established AAA and up-and-coming studios.\\n 3) UGC: The Player Creator \\nWhile modularization of the game development stack focuses on reducing the burden of creation for existing development teams, the rise of UGC brought non-developers into the game creation ecosystem by lowering the knowledge threshold.\\nUGC games have their roots in modding culture, which has always been integral to game fandom among technically-capable and deeply dedicated fans. Experimentation with mods has led to popular games like Dota 2 (Warcraft III) and Counterstrike (Half-Life) that developed gameplay and mechanics reused in other games (e.g. League of Legends and Valorant). Similarly, we expect that the continued growth of UGC is leading to a flood of new game concepts and mechanics that can be leveraged on or off those platforms.\\nModding has also been critical to growth strategies for game communities. For example, Maxis released modding toolkits for The Sims in 2000 before the game itself, in order to stimulate a community that increased the quantity of in-game assets. By allowing players to create specialized in-game assets, the game became both larger and more personalized. Perhaps more importantly, these toolkits and templates provided easier onramps for players to begin creating. Similarly, the extent of documentation and ease of use of UGC services like Roblox Studio has increased the top-of-the-funnel of future game developers and created a “developer flywheel” that encourages others to create games.\\nThe UGC Developer Flywheel — Unlike the traditional developer flywheel where game development is technically difficult and few players become developers, UGC makes game creation exceedingly easy. As more players experiment and create novel game experiences, other players are attracted to create as well. (Source: Lightspeed)\\n More future developers mean even more unbounded experimentation and exploration of what games can be. Games were never intended for only one demographic; UGC began to unlock who games are made for and who makes them.\\n 4) The Dawn of the AI-Powered Studio \\nGaming has always had a special relationship with cutting-edge AI: games simulate human life just as AI simulates human intelligence. For example, in 2001, Halo’s gameplay felt revolutionary because of the novelty of its enemy AI: unlike FPS games before, enemies wouldn’t just run at players. Instead, enemies had rudimentary personalities: elite troops knew to take cover when under fire and aggressively attack when their health was low. The improved AI created a more realistic simulation for players and deepened their engagement with the game.\\nBuilding on modularization in game development and the rise of UGC, AI is supercharging game studios by creating engines and tools sets that automate the tedious aspects of game development and allowing anyone to build high-quality games. We expect the AI platform shift will touch every aspect of the game development stack including object and environment creation and developer tooling.\\nAI Expands the Possibility Frontier — Game developers typically face a tradeoff between creativity and efficiency: the most cost-effective ways to build games often sacrifice creativity and vice versa. By acting as a multiplying force in the game development process, AI expands what is possible at any budget. (Source: Lightspeed)\\n We are already seeing AI-based innovation in art and asset creation pipelines for games increasing the level of personalization in gaming and the speed of development. Hypothetic, Luma AI, and others are building a future for anyone to nearly instantly generate 3D objects and models from prompts and other images removing the traditional pain associated with concepting, moving from high-fidelity to low-fidelity models, UV unwrapping and texture baking.\\nOf course, the key to the creative possibility of these objects will be the production-ready granularity of the object’s hierarchy. For example, models will need to be able to generate a car, but also contain logic to be able to regenerate just the side mirrors. With an explosion of potential characters and objects resulting from AI, it will be critical for animation teams to deploy these at scale. Tools like Move.ai, Latent Technology, and others accelerate the most time-consuming and expensive aspects of motion capture, animation and rigging.\\nIn addition to object creation and animation, modular AI tools are being used to design game environments: Blockade Labs’ Skybox AI creates panoramic scenes from text-inputs. Importantly, these off-the-shelf asset creation tools can work alongside incumbent engines which are aiding in the discovery of these tools directly through storefronts like the Unity’s Asset Store.\\nAI will play an equally critical role in developer and mod tooling for the benefit of game teams alleviating some of the worst aspects of AAA’s crunch culture. Copiloting developer toolkits like those developed by incumbents like Unity or startups like Common Sense Machines and Rosebud AI will reduce the time required to write and deploy new code by translating natural language into 3D worlds and allowing for real-time ideation and iteration. In addition to creation, AI will also impact quality assurance and testing. Today, large teams of manual play testers often comprise as much as 10% of game development budgets. QA teams soon will be able to use tools like Agentic or modl.ai to improve their testing processes requiring less human time on the mundane aspects of testing and can instead focus on the quality of gameplay.\\nWhereas studios before would have to choose between creativity and efficiency, AI expands the possibilities frontier by obviating that tradeoff allowing pipelines to scale based on imagination rather than resources.\\nAI-Native Games: The New Paradigm in Player Experiences\\nWhile the preceding cost and efficiency improvements from AI adoption in game development are significant, we believe what makes AI highly potent for the gaming industry and what will unseat incumbents are the novel experiences that AI permits in games. While we don’t yet know the full range of these experiences, some examples being built today are multiplayer experiences with conversant NPCs with human-like personalities, dynamic in-game social experiences, and hyper-real and immersive graphics.\\n Characters and Logic—Not Environments and Graphics \\nIn the physical world, the quality of our experiences typically isn’t defined by where we are as much as by whom we are with. The same is true for virtual worlds: engaging experiences with friends and strangers outweigh the importance of graphical fidelity. Yet game developer tools primarily focus on creating environments—instead of lifelike non-player characters (NPCs).\\nIn our view, object creation and environment design are just the beginning of new forms of personalization that AI will allow. We believe that the most exciting impact of AI will be in creating entirely new experiences that enrich gameplay and tailor the experiences to the player. It is easy to see how generative agents that can interact, plan, and reflect alongside players would revolutionize the player-experience.\\nAs the frontrunner of such character engines for 3D experiences, Inworld has built player and contextually aware AI NPCs that are able to mimic the full range of human expression and emotions. Inworld blends the modularization revolution, UGC explosion, and AI. The platform integrates into the developer stack through simple APIs into any scaled game development engine and platform.\\n Inworld’s technology and experiences go beyond existing large language models (LLMs). Unlike chatbots, the company supports multimodal character expression by orchestrating multiple machine learning models that are designed to mimic the full-range of human communication. The platform allows developers to link Inworld’s character brains to their animation and rigging systems, including in 3D environments: Inworld provides export capabilities into Unreal Engine, Unity, Roblox, or Minecraft, among others. Smart NPCs can learn and adapt, navigate relationships with emotional intelligence, have memory and recall, and are capable of autonomously initiating goals, performing actions, and following their own motivations that can drive the narrative and integrate with the broader player experience.\\nInworld AI Experiences across Disney, NetEase, Niantic, Elder Scrolls, Roblox and Minecraft — Game developers can create rich characters with deep personalities and motivations in Inworld Studio. (Source: Inworld AI)\\n  Endless Possibility of AI in Games \\nWe similarly expect games to change game loops themselves. Companies like Hidden Door and Storycraft are creating AI-based story-driven games that provide a constant stream of novel and highly-personalized experiences to players. For example, the objective of a game could be changed based on a player’s Bartle type, which would grow the audience that any one game could garner. In-game social experiences could also be improved as AI provides a solution to toxicity and cheating online through proactive and real-time tools like GGWP and Modulate, and could assist in reducing churn from negative behaviors online.\\nFurther down the game development stack, rendering and network latency issues could be improved by image generation techniques as GPU performance and costs improve. Instead of rendering each frame, engines could create high frequency and quality frames by interpolating across a range of lower quality frames provided at a lower frame rate using AI to fill in changes locally on the device. An early example of this was achieved by researchers at Intel Labs in 2021 who created a photorealistic version of GTA V by training a model on the Cityscapes dataset. These improvements could not only allow for higher quality graphics, but also larger matchmaking pools and more competitive gameplay, as less data would need to be transferred across networks.\\n Gaming x AI Market Map \\nSome of the companies working on AI in gaming—contextualized against the other stages of video game development—are shown below.

Game infrastructure improvements on the development-front like Adobe Flash and GameMaker Studio and the distribution-front like Steam and XBox Live. These tools together allowed smaller developer teams to build games efficiently while still reaching meaningful scale. Creating compelling game mechanics and assets became the focus, rather than developing the low-level systems to power their game environments or searching for a partner to publish their games to offset expanding development budgets. Modularization reduced costs through standardization of the game development stack.\\nWe believe the modular model and further standardization are here to stay as the benefits of modularization extend beyond increasing development speed and agility. By standardizing aspects of game development, we expect an increase in the pace of iteration and a growth in the scope of games per developer, especially in live-service formats.\\nVelocity of Creation and Iteration Will Drive Future Revenues — While the majority of revenues today are concentrated in traditional monolithic architectures (e.g. EA, Activision), increased efficiency in game creation will allow games to be closely tailored to player preferences. Revenue will likewise shift towards studios that iterate and adapt fastest. (Source: Lightspeed)\\nA second-wave of modularization has been underway for the past few years. Companies like Pragma, inspired by the success of engines like Unity and Unreal Engine, are building plug-and-play solutions for complex yet tedious aspects of the game backend including matchmaking, battle passes, and inventory management. Similarly, Hathora provides serverless hosting for multiplayer games so teams have less game launch anxiety. We think it’s critical for solutions to find the right balance between standardization and extensibility to be able to sell into both established AAA and up-and-coming studios.\\n3) UGC: The Player Creator\\nWhile modularization of the game development stack focuses on reducing the burden of creation for existing development teams, the rise of UGC brought non-developers into the game creation ecosystem by lowering the knowledge threshold.\\nUGC games have their roots in modding culture, which has always been integral to game fandom among technically-capable and deeply dedicated fans. Experimentation with mods has led to popular games like Dota 2 (Warcraft III) and Counterstrike (Half-Life) that developed gameplay and mechanics reused in other games (e.g. League of Legends and Valorant). Similarly, we expect that the continued growth of UGC is leading to a flood of new game concepts and mechanics that can be leveraged on or off those platforms.\\nModding has also been critical to growth strategies for game communities. For example, Maxis released modding toolkits for The Sims in 2000 before the game itself, in order to stimulate a community that increased the quantity of in-game assets. By allowing players to create specialized in-game assets, the game became both larger and more personalized. Perhaps more importantly, these toolkits and templates provided easier onramps for players to begin creating. Similarly, the extent of documentation and ease of use of UGC services like Roblox Studio has increased the top-of-the-funnel of future game developers and created a “developer flywheel” that encourages others to create games.\\nThe UGC Developer Flywheel — Unlike the traditional developer flywheel where game development is technically difficult and few players become developers, UGC makes game creation exceedingly easy. As more players experiment and create novel game experiences, other players are attracted to create as well. (Source: Lightspeed)\\nMore future developers mean even more unbounded experimentation and exploration of what games can be. Games were never intended for only one demographic; UGC began to unlock who games are made for and who makes them.\\n4) The Dawn of the AI-Powered Studio\\nGaming has always had a special relationship with cutting-edge AI: games simulate human life just as AI simulates human intelligence. For example, in 2001, Halo’s gameplay felt revolutionary because of the novelty of its enemy AI: unlike FPS games before, enemies wouldn’t just run at players. Instead, enemies had rudimentary personalities: elite troops knew to take cover when under fire and aggressively attack when their health was low. The improved AI created a more realistic simulation for players and deepened their engagement with the game.\\nBuilding on modularization in game development and the rise of UGC, AI is supercharging game studios by creating engines and tools sets that automate the tedious aspects of game development and allowing anyone to build high-quality games. We expect the AI platform shift will touch every aspect of the game development stack including object and environment creation and developer tooling.\\nAI Expands the Possibility Frontier — Game developers typically face a tradeoff between creativity and efficiency: the most cost-effective ways to build games often sacrifice creativity and vice versa. By acting as a multiplying force in the game development process, AI expands what is possible at any budget. (Source: Lightspeed)\\nWe are already seeing AI-based innovation in art and asset creation pipelines for games increasing the level of personalization in gaming and the speed of development. Hypothetic, Luma AI, and others are building a future for anyone to nearly instantly generate 3D objects and models from prompts and other images removing the traditional pain associated with concepting, moving from high-fidelity to low-fidelity models, UV unwrapping and texture baking.\\nOf course, the key to the creative possibility of these objects will be the production-ready granularity of the object’s hierarchy. For example, models will need to be able to generate a car, but also contain logic to be able to regenerate just the side mirrors. With an explosion of potential characters and objects resulting from AI, it will be critical for animation teams to deploy these at scale. Tools like Move.ai, Latent Technology, and others accelerate the most time-consuming and expensive aspects of motion capture, animation and rigging.\\nIn addition to object creation and animation, modular AI tools are being used to design game environments: Blockade Labs’ Skybox AI creates panoramic scenes from text-inputs. Importantly, these off-the-shelf asset creation tools can work alongside incumbent engines which are aiding in the discovery of these tools directly through storefronts like the Unity’s Asset Store.\\nAI will play an equally critical role in developer and mod tooling for the benefit of game teams alleviating some of the worst aspects of AAA’s crunch culture. Copiloting developer toolkits like those developed by incumbents like Unity or startups like Common Sense Machines and Rosebud AI will reduce the time required to write and deploy new code by translating natural language into 3D worlds and allowing for real-time ideation and iteration. In addition to creation, AI will also impact quality assurance and testing. Today, large teams of manual play testers often comprise as much as 10% of game development budgets. QA teams soon will be able to use tools like Agentic or modl.ai to improve their testing processes requiring less human time on the mundane aspects of testing and can instead focus on the quality of gameplay.\\nWhereas studios before would have to choose between creativity and efficiency, AI expands the possibilities frontier by obviating that tradeoff allowing pipelines to scale based on imagination rather than resources.\\nAI-Native Games: The New Paradigm in Player Experiences\\nWhile the preceding cost and efficiency improvements from AI adoption in game development are significant, we believe what makes AI highly potent for the gaming industry and what will unseat incumbents are the novel experiences that AI permits in games. While we don’t yet know the full range of these experiences, some examples being built today are multiplayer experiences with conversant NPCs with human-like personalities, dynamic in-game social experiences, and hyper-real and immersive graphics.\\nCharacters and Logic—Not Environments and Graphics\\nIn the physical world, the quality of our experiences typically isn’t defined by where we are as much as by whom we are with. The same is true for virtual worlds: engaging experiences with friends and strangers outweigh the importance of graphical fidelity. Yet game developer tools primarily focus on creating environments—instead of lifelike non-player characters (NPCs).\\nIn our view, object creation and environment design are just the beginning of new forms of personalization that AI will allow. We believe that the most exciting impact of AI will be in creating entirely new experiences that enrich gameplay and tailor the experiences to the player. It is easy to see how generative agents that can interact, plan, and reflect alongside players would revolutionize the player-experience.\\nAs the frontrunner of such character engines for 3D experiences, Inworld has built player and contextually aware AI NPCs that are able to mimic the full range of human expression and emotions. Inworld blends the modularization revolution, UGC explosion, and AI. The platform integrates into the developer stack through simple APIs into any scaled game development engine and platform.\\nInworld’s technology and experiences go beyond existing large language models (LLMs). Unlike chatbots, the company supports multimodal character expression by orchestrating multiple machine learning models that are designed to mimic the full-range of human communication. The platform allows developers to link Inworld’s character brains to their animation and rigging systems, including in 3D environments: Inworld provides export capabilities into Unreal Engine, Unity, Roblox, or Minecraft, among others. Smart NPCs can learn and adapt, navigate relationships with emotional intelligence, have memory and recall, and are capable of autonomously initiating goals, performing actions, and following their own motivations that can drive the narrative and integrate with the broader player experience.\\nInworld AI Experiences across Disney, NetEase, Niantic, Elder Scrolls, Roblox and Minecraft — Game developers can create rich characters with deep personalities and motivations in Inworld Studio. (Source: Inworld AI)\\nEndless Possibility of AI in Games\\nWe similarly expect games to change game loops themselves. Companies like Hidden Door and Storycraft are creating AI-based story-driven games that provide a constant stream of novel and highly-personalized experiences to players. For example, the objective of a game could be changed based on a player’s Bartle type, which would grow the audience that any one game could garner. In-game social experiences could also be improved as AI provides a solution to toxicity and cheating online through proactive and real-time tools like GGWP and Modulate, and could assist in reducing churn from negative behaviors online.\\nFurther down the game development stack, rendering and network latency issues could be improved by image generation techniques as GPU performance and costs improve. Instead of rendering each frame, engines could create high frequency and quality frames by interpolating across a range of lower quality frames provided at a lower frame rate using AI to fill in changes locally on the device. An early example of this was achieved by researchers at Intel Labs in 2021 who created a photorealistic version of GTA V by training a model on the Cityscapes dataset. These improvements could not only allow for higher quality graphics, but also larger matchmaking pools and more competitive gameplay, as less data would need to be transferred across networks.\\nGaming x AI Market Map\\nSome of the companies working on AI in gaming—contextualized against the other stages of video game development—are shown below.

       "    'Technology is evolving at a fast pace. Imagine if we could pick the visions and ideas and make them come true. 2023 is currently shaping up to be the year of promise for the VR gaming industry. Highly anticipated components have paved their way into the hands of the people. Virtual reality games, in particular, have come a long way from the lukewarm response they received in their early years. However, a lot has happened since then. Let’s take a quick trip to learn about the impending trends in the VR gaming industry.  What is VR — A Quick Explanation!  Virtual reality focuses on introducing a virtual world with which people can interact. Virtual reality uses software to create realistic images, sounds, and other senses that replicate a real environment and mimic a user’s physical presence within this environment, controlled or experienced by body movement. The virtual world tries to be a completely different experience from the real reality in the understanding of the user. Full virtual reality can be experienced using virtual reality equipment. If you are thinking to develop a casino game, then you should connect with a casino   game development company  for better assistance.  VR (Virtual Reality) in the Gaming Marketplace:  Virtual reality has a huge reach in the gaming market. For many people, the allure can be the ability to see an underwater world or an exotic place or do something that they could not do otherwise. Bridging the gap between worlds seems like a sweet spot for virtual reality technology. Evidence of the accelerated advancement of digital technology over the years can be understood through the gaming industry. From ancient times to the first 3D video game, it shows that the gaming industry has seen its fair share of technological progress. Head-mounted gear will make a difference in the way VR incorporates gaming. A leading  Unity 3d game development services  provider explained that gaming is the biggest driver of VR and it will certainly continue in the near future. Unsurprisingly, gamers are some of the most enthusiastic VR pushers around. So let’s move further, to learn about the major trends we see in the VR gaming industry.  Emerging Trends to Watch Out in the VR Gaming Industry  Take a look at some emerging trends to get an idea of how the VR gaming industry will take off in the field of gaming.  Mobile VR Gaming  The virtual reality (VR) market is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 63.3% between 2018 and 2025, as stated in a Valuation report. By 2025, it will grow at a CAGR of $571 billion. This growth is primarily driven by the continued use of smart devices, an increase in Internet connectivity, and the growth of mobile games. North America continues to have the largest share of the VR market, but the Asia-Pacific market will expand the most, with India, China, Japan, and South Korea experiencing the highest demand for mounted gaming device screens. in the lead in the virtual reality market.   However, the industry will continue to struggle due to a lack of effective user experience design and slow adoption in underdeveloped economies.  Immersive Sporting and Events  Sporting events now meet gaming in the world of immersive experiences. Large companies and sporting events are already investing in virtual and augmented reality to enhance sporting events. With immersive reality, people can enjoy sports and events in virtual meetings that go far beyond ordinary video conferencing. It can also help to better analyze games and events. The enhancement in VR and AR technologies will allow fans to feel immersed in the games and employees and partners can feel immersed and engaged in meetings and events.  Facebook and Rising Metaverse Technology  Facebook acquired a virtual reality development company called Oculus, which included the Oculus Rift. If you’re wondering what the Oculus Rift is, it’s a solid step into VR gaming and its immersive nature. When the acquisition took place, it almost seemed silly. No one could find a sensible justification for the social media giant to acquire a virtual reality game company. But after Facebook went Meta, the apparent reason surfaced. Meta is getting used to the concept of the metaverse like several other companies. The metaverse is nothing more than a virtual world for users to join and interact with. As per a  mobile game development company in India , The social media platform will be able to attract more users with its steps into the metaverse. Meanwhile, Oculus will benefit from the social media giant’s strong user base of 1 billion. Oculus2 could soon become the only way to gain access to Meta and its many aspects in the metaverse. Since Meta now owns Oculus, it’s likely to grow beyond just a gaming platform. Users may soon need to use Oculus VR technology as the primary tool for entering and interacting in Meta’s virtual world. Also, blockchain gaming technology or cryptographic technology is evolving beyond imagination. Therefore, we can also witness an improvement in the virtual reality experience.  5G Network Will Impact  5G VR cloud gaming is further enhancing the VR gaming industry market. In order to offer customers services with high latency and low bandwidth, a number of virtual reality gaming businesses are concentrating on 5G VR cloud gaming.  Attend Live Game Events  According to the study carried out by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, consumer applications, including video games and live game events will generate $18.9 billion in the next 9 years in the video game sector, with a lead of $11,600 million.    VR Uses in the Future: Who It Benefits  So we know where VR is headed in the short term, but what about the long term? Based on the trends, we want to look into the far future of VR and make some predictions: how will it be used in a few years?  Full-body Motion Tracking  For now, VR apps mainly track the movements of our heads and possibly our hands. In the future, we might see full-body tracking with users wearing a special suit or simply attaching some sensors to their clothing. This should be very useful in security training, as virtual reality simulators will not only test the knowledge of the users, but also the precision of their movements.  Parks for Physical Activity  One of the current limiting factors of VR is that apps need to be designed for very careful and limited movement of the user. However, a few years from now, everyone could have a playground where they can use virtual reality and also move physically: bend, run, jump, etc. without any risk of getting physically hurt. This would be huge for the gaming industry, which will jump at the opportunity to provide a much more engaging experience for its customers.    Immersive Movies  In the distant future, we could see virtual reality headsets and glasses replacing or replacing televisions and movie theaters. People will be able to get the entertainment they want right in front of their eyes without having to go anywhere or invest in a big screen for their homes. By making movies more immersive, the entertainment industry could contribute to this trend. They can allow people to see events unfold from more than one angle and perhaps influence character choices.  It’s High-time to Invest in VR Game Development  We’ve given you just a small taste of the future of VR for the gaming industry, so what will your course of action be: stick with known technologies and existing solutions, or innovate and give your customers/employees something more? with virtual reality? A custom VR/Metaverse gaming app can do wonders for your business and establish your company as a pioneer in its respective field. If you choose to create a VR gaming app, your first step should be to  hire a game developer  who can develop the VR game considering all the trends we have mentioned. So, browse the internet and research a reliable VR game development company for your dream project.  ||||I|||| Open in app\\nSign up\\nSign In\\nWrite\\nSign up\\nSign In\\nPublished in\\nAR/VR Journey: Augmented & Virtual Reality Magazine\\nGautam Raturi\\nFollow\\nJan 6\\n·\\n6 min read\\nSave\\nEmerging Trends in the VR Gaming Industry — 2023\\nTechnology is evolving at a fast pace.

       "  'Who are the major players and what are the competitive dynamics in the NPC-as-a-Service market across AR, MR, and gaming sectors?': {'search_query': '\"major players NPC-as-a-Service market AR MR gaming sectors competitive dynamics 2023\"',\n",
       "   'search_results': ['AI NPCs  Last week, a group of Stanford computer science researchers led by Joon Sung Park announced a project called Smallville where 25 AI agents inhabit a virtual world. These agents are completely unaware they are inhabiting a simulated environment and help uncover the complexities and opportunities around multi-agent emergence.Â  At Konvoy, we believe that AI non-playable characters (NPCs) are one of the most compelling opportunities for AI in games, and even in other industries such as sales, defense, and healthcare. Here are three key use cases we are excited about:Â   Emergent gameplay Populating virtual experiences Simulations   Use Case #1: Emergent Gameplay  This use case explores the concept of emergent gameplay through the utilization of expanded knowledge and limited autonomy for NPCs in video games. This has the potential to transform player experiences by introducing greater complexity, unpredictability, and immersion into gaming environments.  Dynamic NPC Knowledge and Immersive Gameplay: The integration of expanded knowledge and limited autonomy into NPCs has the potential to create a dynamic game world that reacts to player actions in more nuanced ways. Unlike traditional NPCs that possess static dialogue and actions, dynamically informed NPCs would evolve alongside player choices. This interactive element could make every playthrough unique and encourage players to explore various strategies and pathways to interact with the game world.  Expanding Player Choice: By giving NPCs a more sophisticated understanding of the player\\'s actions and intentions, emergent gameplay allows for greater freedom of choice. Players can create alliances, build relationships, or even manipulate NPCs based on a dynamic exchange of information. This expands the possibilities for branching narratives and multiple outcomes, enhancing replayability and player agency.  Multi-Layered Player-NPC Interactions: As NPCs\\' reactions are influenced by dynamic knowledge and simulated emotions, the potential for multi-layered interactions between players and NPCs becomes a reality. Players must now consider the potential consequences of their actions more carefully, as NPCs\\' responses become more organic and context-dependent. This introduces an added layer of challenge and depth to the gameplay.  Immersion and Believable Game Worlds: Emergent gameplay through dynamic NPC knowledge allows for the creation of more immersive game worlds. As NPCs evolve alongside player actions, game environments will feel more authentic and realistic, giving players influence on the narrative. This level of immersion can enhance emotional investment, leading to a more engaging and captivating overall gaming experience.  Diverse Gameplay Experiences: In games with expansive open worlds, such as Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption 2, emergent gameplay can offer a nearly endless variety of gameplay experiences. NPCs with dynamic knowledge create a dynamic ecosystem where events can emerge naturally based on player choices. This enriches the player\\'s journey, encouraging experimentation and exploration of different storylines. While emergent gameplay introduces exciting possibilities, it also poses challenges. Balancing dynamic NPC behavior to ensure that it remains challenging and coherent without becoming overwhelming or frustrating is essential. Additionally, maintaining the integrity of the game\\'s narrative while allowing for dynamic interactions will be complex.  Use Case #2: Populating Virtual Experiences to Represent Reality  This use case dives into the idea that the vision of the \"metaverse,\" a shared virtual space where people can interact, work, and socialize, doesn\\'t necessarily require every participant to be a real human player. Instead, the thesis suggests that AI-controlled non-playable characters (NPCs) could play a pivotal role in enhancing the believability and scale of virtual experiences, particularly in situations where technical limitations hinder massive real-player interactions.  Scale and Realism in Virtual Spaces: The concept of a metaverse is often visualized as massive virtual cities, crowded stadiums, and bustling marketplaces, mirroring real-world interactions on an unprecedented scale. However, achieving this level of interaction with real players presents technical challenges, including server capacity, synchronization, and maintaining a consistent quality of experience. AI NPCs can bridge this gap by populating these virtual spaces, creating the illusion of a vibrant environment.  Overcoming Technical Constraints:',\n",

       "    'An (inevitably incomplete) overview of the emerging landscape of artificial intelligence and procedural generation in interactive media\\nLightspeed &amp; GamesBeat present the top 25 startups in gaming. Apply or nominate today!\\nLearn more about our investment in Inworld AI, the leading character engine for AI NPCs.\\nIntelligent worlds and characters — Inworld AI’s “Origins” is a glimpse into the future of AI-driven video games. Players take on the role of a detective in a neo-noir world filled with intelligent non-player characters (NPCs)—and using nothing but microphones and their creativity, players are tasked with questioning witnesses, uncovering the narrative, and cracking the case. (Source: Inworld AI)\\n At Lightspeed, we are believers in the power of gaming as the ultimate online social experience—one where creativity, skill, and collaboration meet to become joy. It’s no wonder why gamers are some of the most engaged and retentive audiences of any consumer vertical.\\nWe’ve seen this first-hand through our gaming investments since 2006—from early wins like Playdom and Snap to recent breakouts like Epic Games, Polygon, and Tripledot Studios. With the share of global gamers continuing to grow, younger demographics choosing games to socialize and learn, and strong technological tailwinds, it’s obvious why we continue to be focused on the industry.\\nThe Infinite Power of Play\\nBut there’s something even bigger to be said about “the infinite power of play.” For half a century, video games have profoundly shaped consumer behavior and acted as a catalyst for significant technological innovation. With the advent of the ‘Metaverse,’ and as an ever-increasing time of our lives is spent in immersive virtual worlds, gaming is expected to continue its pivotal role in how we play, work, and connect.\\nMany life-changing technologies were born in gaming, in part because (1) interactive experiences are often pushing the boundaries of what’s technologically possible and (2) play and innovation are inevitably intertwined: play is “safe exploration,” and work is “exploitation of learned patterns,” not too indifferent of how some of AI works. The best-scaled example of cross-sector breakthroughs that originated in gaming is probably NVIDIA: originally built to perform complex 3D calculations in video games, now our most powerful computational engine and the backbone of all AI, blockchain, and so much more.\\nSeizing Platform Shifts with Novel Experiences—Not Incremental Improvements\\nMany of the past technological and cultural tailwinds felt like incremental building blocks. (By the way, the gaming industry has only seen one “down year” since 1997—in 2022, coming out of an inflated 2020 and 2021 post-COVID influx; 2023 is up again.)\\nIn contrast, the dawn of artificial intelligence and procedural intelligence appears more akin to a platform shift in line with the rise of the consumer internet around the start of the millennium, or the introduction of the mass-market mobile smartphone in 2007.\\nHistorically speaking, in platform shifts like these, generational companies won’t only incrementally improve upon existing workflows with faster, better, or cheaper tools; they will create completely novel, previously impossible user experiences—like intelligent non-player characters (NPCs) and generative agents that go far beyond pre-programmed decision trees and limited narrative choices.\\n Zynga’s rise through mobile, casual gaming modalities and Rovio’s innovations in tactile touchscreen experiences are great examples from the gaming world, where a newcomer capitalized on a new reality of consumer experiences despite the incumbents’ (in this case, Electronic Arts or Activision) perceived resource advantage. A textbook example of corporate inertia and the innovator’s dilemma.\\nAt Lightspeed, we expect the shift to artificial intelligence and procedural generation will be no different. Those unable to deliver these new experiences in their games will be left behind as audiences will continue to prefer the most immersive experiences. Much of what seems like a fever dream today will be considered table stakes in a matter of years—not decades.\\nThe 4th Industrial Revolution of Video Games\\nInevitably, the AI platform shift will accelerate the velocity of game creation in ways that are likely hard to conceive today. This article takes a look at what we call the four industrial revolutions of game design. To set the context, we need a little bit of history.\\n 1) The Publisher Model: Gaming’s Stone Age \\nInnovation in gaming has historically focused on improving the technical aspects of the player experience–better graphics, faster processing, or higher player concurrency–which, while important, often came at the expense of improving the game development process and infrastructure itself.\\nThis “publisher model” borne out of the Hollywood studio system favored monolithic architectures produced in silos divided into three categories: hardware (consoles), software (studios), and marketing (publishers). Companies in each category would do a variety of tasks since the gaming market was small and couldn’t justify companies specializing in each segment of the game development process. With everything from engines to objects built for each game, development required larger and larger teams to deliver novel game experiences. AAA game budgets built in this way ballooned to $100M+, raising the stakes to release high-quality games and leading to a reduction in the number of studios that could release such games.\\nAAA Development Costs Balloon — AAA game development costs continue to grow year-over-year. Most recently court filings leaked that 2020’s The Last of Us Part II had a budget of $220M. (Source: VentureBeat)\\n With such high development costs, executives focused on games for their known core market – mostly teenage boys – and wouldn’t take creative risks on development games for other diverse audiences. Two forces bucked that trend: modularization and UGC.\\n 2) Modularization: Refocusing on Gameplay  \\nMonolith development first began to change with the growth of licensed game engines–first id Software’s Doom and Quake Engines and then Epic Games’ Unreal Engine and Unity. These off-the-shelf engines abstracted the creation of the environments that games lived in and sped up the development process in the industry through strong network effects: developers versed in a popular engine used in one game could easily re-use that knowledge in developing another.\\nThis initial wave of modularization of the game development stack–mostly in the early 2000s–saw the rise of indie game developers as we know them today. Game infrastructure improvements on the development-front like Adobe Flash and GameMaker Studio and the distribution-front like Steam and XBox Live. These tools together allowed smaller developer teams to build games efficiently while still reaching meaningful scale. Creating compelling game mechanics and assets became the focus, rather than developing the low-level systems to power their game environments or searching for a partner to publish their games to offset expanding development budgets. Modularization reduced costs through standardization of the game development stack.\\nWe believe the modular model and further standardization are here to stay as the benefits of modularization extend beyond increasing development speed and agility. By standardizing aspects of game development, we expect an increase in the pace of iteration and a growth in the scope of games per developer, especially in live-service formats.\\nVelocity of Creation and Iteration Will Drive Future Revenues — While the majority of revenues today are concentrated in traditional monolithic architectures (e.g. EA, Activision), increased efficiency in game creation will allow games to be closely tailored to player preferences. Revenue will likewise shift towards studios that iterate and adapt fastest. (Source: Lightspeed)\\n A second-wave of modularization has been underway for the past few years. Companies like Pragma, inspired by the success of engines like Unity and Unreal Engine, are building plug-and-play solutions for complex yet tedious aspects of the game backend including matchmaking, battle passes, and inventory management. Similarly, Hathora provides serverless hosting for multiplayer games so teams have less game launch anxiety. We think it’s critical for solutions to find the right balance between standardization and extensibility to be able to sell into both established AAA and up-and-coming studios.\\n 3) UGC: The Player Creator \\nWhile modularization of the game development stack focuses on reducing the burden of creation for existing development teams, the rise of UGC brought non-developers into the game creation ecosystem by lowering the knowledge threshold.\\nUGC games have their roots in modding culture, which has always been integral to game fandom among technically-capable and deeply dedicated fans. Experimentation with mods has led to popular games like Dota 2 (Warcraft III) and Counterstrike (Half-Life) that developed gameplay and mechanics reused in other games (e.g. League of Legends and Valorant). Similarly, we expect that the continued growth of UGC is leading to a flood of new game concepts and mechanics that can be leveraged on or off those platforms.\\nModding has also been critical to growth strategies for game communities. For example, Maxis released modding toolkits for The Sims in 2000 before the game itself, in order to stimulate a community that increased the quantity of in-game assets. By allowing players to create specialized in-game assets, the game became both larger and more personalized. Perhaps more importantly, these toolkits and templates provided easier onramps for players to begin creating. Similarly, the extent of documentation and ease of use of UGC services like Roblox Studio has increased the top-of-the-funnel of future game developers and created a “developer flywheel” that encourages others to create games.\\nThe UGC Developer Flywheel — Unlike the traditional developer flywheel where game development is technically difficult and few players become developers, UGC makes game creation exceedingly easy. As more players experiment and create novel game experiences, other players are attracted to create as well. (Source: Lightspeed)\\n More future developers mean even more unbounded experimentation and exploration of what games can be. Games were never intended for only one demographic; UGC began to unlock who games are made for and who makes them.\\n 4) The Dawn of the AI-Powered Studio \\nGaming has always had a special relationship with cutting-edge AI: games simulate human life just as AI simulates human intelligence. For example, in 2001, Halo’s gameplay felt revolutionary because of the novelty of its enemy AI: unlike FPS games before, enemies wouldn’t just run at players. Instead, enemies had rudimentary personalities: elite troops knew to take cover when under fire and aggressively attack when their health was low. The improved AI created a more realistic simulation for players and deepened their engagement with the game.\\nBuilding on modularization in game development and the rise of UGC, AI is supercharging game studios by creating engines and tools sets that automate the tedious aspects of game development and allowing anyone to build high-quality games. We expect the AI platform shift will touch every aspect of the game development stack including object and environment creation and developer tooling.\\nAI Expands the Possibility Frontier — Game developers typically face a tradeoff between creativity and efficiency: the most cost-effective ways to build games often sacrifice creativity and vice versa. By acting as a multiplying force in the game development process, AI expands what is possible at any budget. (Source: Lightspeed)\\n We are already seeing AI-based innovation in art and asset creation pipelines for games increasing the level of personalization in gaming and the speed of development. Hypothetic, Luma AI, and others are building a future for anyone to nearly instantly generate 3D objects and models from prompts and other images removing the traditional pain associated with concepting, moving from high-fidelity to low-fidelity models, UV unwrapping and texture baking.\\nOf course, the key to the creative possibility of these objects will be the production-ready granularity of the object’s hierarchy. For example, models will need to be able to generate a car, but also contain logic to be able to regenerate just the side mirrors. With an explosion of potential characters and objects resulting from AI, it will be critical for animation teams to deploy these at scale. Tools like Move.ai, Latent Technology, and others accelerate the most time-consuming and expensive aspects of motion capture, animation and rigging.\\nIn addition to object creation and animation, modular AI tools are being used to design game environments: Blockade Labs’ Skybox AI creates panoramic scenes from text-inputs. Importantly, these off-the-shelf asset creation tools can work alongside incumbent engines which are aiding in the discovery of these tools directly through storefronts like the Unity’s Asset Store.\\nAI will play an equally critical role in developer and mod tooling for the benefit of game teams alleviating some of the worst aspects of AAA’s crunch culture. Copiloting developer toolkits like those developed by incumbents like Unity or startups like Common Sense Machines and Rosebud AI will reduce the time required to write and deploy new code by translating natural language into 3D worlds and allowing for real-time ideation and iteration. In addition to creation, AI will also impact quality assurance and testing. Today, large teams of manual play testers often comprise as much as 10% of game development budgets. QA teams soon will be able to use tools like Agentic or modl.ai to improve their testing processes requiring less human time on the mundane aspects of testing and can instead focus on the quality of gameplay.\\nWhereas studios before would have to choose between creativity and efficiency, AI expands the possibilities frontier by obviating that tradeoff allowing pipelines to scale based on imagination rather than resources.\\nAI-Native Games: The New Paradigm in Player Experiences\\nWhile the preceding cost and efficiency improvements from AI adoption in game development are significant, we believe what makes AI highly potent for the gaming industry and what will unseat incumbents are the novel experiences that AI permits in games. While we don’t yet know the full range of these experiences, some examples being built today are multiplayer experiences with conversant NPCs with human-like personalities, dynamic in-game social experiences, and hyper-real and immersive graphics.\\n Characters and Logic—Not Environments and Graphics \\nIn the physical world, the quality of our experiences typically isn’t defined by where we are as much as by whom we are with. The same is true for virtual worlds: engaging experiences with friends and strangers outweigh the importance of graphical fidelity. Yet game developer tools primarily focus on creating environments—instead of lifelike non-player characters (NPCs).\\nIn our view, object creation and environment design are just the beginning of new forms of personalization that AI will allow. We believe that the most exciting impact of AI will be in creating entirely new experiences that enrich gameplay and tailor the experiences to the player. It is easy to see how generative agents that can interact, plan, and reflect alongside players would revolutionize the player-experience.\\nAs the frontrunner of such character engines for 3D experiences, Inworld has built player and contextually aware AI NPCs that are able to mimic the full range of human expression and emotions. Inworld blends the modularization revolution, UGC explosion, and AI. The platform integrates into the developer stack through simple APIs into any scaled game development engine and platform.\\n Inworld’s technology and experiences go beyond existing large language models (LLMs). Unlike chatbots, the company supports multimodal character expression by orchestrating multiple machine learning models that are designed to mimic the full-range of human communication. The platform allows developers to link Inworld’s character brains to their animation and rigging systems, including in 3D environments: Inworld provides export capabilities into Unreal Engine, Unity, Roblox, or Minecraft, among others. Smart NPCs can learn and adapt, navigate relationships with emotional intelligence, have memory and recall, and are capable of autonomously initiating goals, performing actions, and following their own motivations that can drive the narrative and integrate with the broader player experience.\\nInworld AI Experiences across Disney, NetEase, Niantic, Elder Scrolls, Roblox and Minecraft — Game developers can create rich characters with deep personalities and motivations in Inworld Studio. (Source: Inworld AI)\\n  Endless Possibility of AI in Games \\nWe similarly expect games to change game loops themselves. Companies like Hidden Door and Storycraft are creating AI-based story-driven games that provide a constant stream of novel and highly-personalized experiences to players. For example, the objective of a game could be changed based on a player’s Bartle type, which would grow the audience that any one game could garner. In-game social experiences could also be improved as AI provides a solution to toxicity and cheating online through proactive and real-time tools like GGWP and Modulate, and could assist in reducing churn from negative behaviors online.\\nFurther down the game development stack, rendering and network latency issues could be improved by image generation techniques as GPU performance and costs improve. Instead of rendering each frame, engines could create high frequency and quality frames by interpolating across a range of lower quality frames provided at a lower frame rate using AI to fill in changes locally on the device. An early example of this was achieved by researchers at Intel Labs in 2021 who created a photorealistic version of GTA V by training a model on the Cityscapes dataset. These improvements could not only allow for higher quality graphics, but also larger matchmaking pools and more competitive gameplay, as less data would need to be transferred across networks.\\n Gaming x AI Market Map \\nSome of the companies working on AI in gaming—contextualized against the other stages of video game development—are shown below.

Apply or nominate today!\\nLearn more about our investment in Inworld AI, the leading character engine for AI NPCs.\\nIntelligent worlds and characters — Inworld AI’s “Origins” is a glimpse into the future of AI-driven video games. Players take on the role of a detective in a neo-noir world filled with intelligent non-player characters (NPCs)—and using nothing but microphones and their creativity, players are tasked with questioning witnesses, uncovering the narrative, and cracking the case. (Source: Inworld AI)\\nAt Lightspeed, we are believers in the power of gaming as the ultimate online social experience—one where creativity, skill, and collaboration meet to become joy. It’s no wonder why gamers are some of the most engaged and retentive audiences of any consumer vertical.\\nWe’ve seen this first-hand through our gaming investments since 2006—from early wins like Playdom and Snap to recent breakouts like Epic Games, Polygon, and Tripledot Studios. With the share of global gamers continuing to grow, younger demographics choosing games to socialize and learn, and strong technological tailwinds, it’s obvious why we continue to be focused on the industry.\\nThe Infinite Power of Play\\nBut there’s something even bigger to be said about “the infinite power of play.” For half a century, video games have profoundly shaped consumer behavior and acted as a catalyst for significant technological innovation. With the advent of the ‘Metaverse,’ and as an ever-increasing time of our lives is spent in immersive virtual worlds, gaming is expected to continue its pivotal role in how we play, work, and connect.\\nMany life-changing technologies were born in gaming, in part because (1) interactive experiences are often pushing the boundaries of what’s technologically possible and (2) play and innovation are inevitably intertwined: play is “safe exploration,” and work is “exploitation of learned patterns,” not too indifferent of how some of AI works. The best-scaled example of cross-sector breakthroughs that originated in gaming is probably NVIDIA: originally built to perform complex 3D calculations in video games, now our most powerful computational engine and the backbone of all AI, blockchain, and so much more.\\nSeizing Platform Shifts with Novel Experiences—Not Incremental Improvements\\nMany of the past technological and cultural tailwinds felt like incremental building blocks. (By the way, the gaming industry has only seen one “down year” since 1997—in 2022, coming out of an inflated 2020 and 2021 post-COVID influx; 2023 is up again.)\\nIn contrast, the dawn of artificial intelligence and procedural intelligence appears more akin to a platform shift in line with the rise of the consumer internet around the start of the millennium, or the introduction of the mass-market mobile smartphone in 2007.\\nHistorically speaking, in platform shifts like these, generational companies won’t only incrementally improve upon existing workflows with faster, better, or cheaper tools; they will create completely novel, previously impossible user experiences—like intelligent non-player characters (NPCs) and generative agents that go far beyond pre-programmed decision trees and limited narrative choices.\\nZynga’s rise through mobile, casual gaming modalities and Rovio’s innovations in tactile touchscreen experiences are great examples from the gaming world, where a newcomer capitalized on a new reality of consumer experiences despite the incumbents’ (in this case, Electronic Arts or Activision) perceived resource advantage. A textbook example of corporate inertia and the innovator’s dilemma.\\nAt Lightspeed, we expect the shift to artificial intelligence and procedural generation will be no different. Those unable to deliver these new experiences in their games will be left behind as audiences will continue to prefer the most immersive experiences. Much of what seems like a fever dream today will be considered table stakes in a matter of years—not decades.\\nThe 4th Industrial Revolution of Video Games\\nInevitably, the AI platform shift will accelerate the velocity of game creation in ways that are likely hard to conceive today. This article takes a look at what we call the four industrial revolutions of game design. To set the context, we need a little bit of history.\\n1) The Publisher Model: Gaming’s Stone Age\\nInnovation in gaming has historically focused on improving the technical aspects of the player experience–better graphics, faster processing, or higher player concurrency–which, while important, often came at the expense of improving the game development process and infrastructure itself.\\nThis “publisher model” borne out of the Hollywood studio system favored monolithic architectures produced in silos divided into three categories: hardware (consoles), software (studios), and marketing (publishers). Companies in each category would do a variety of tasks since the gaming market was small and couldn’t justify companies specializing in each segment of the game development process. With everything from engines to objects built for each game, development required larger and larger teams to deliver novel game experiences. AAA game budgets built in this way ballooned to $100M+, raising the stakes to release high-quality games and leading to a reduction in the number of studios that could release such games.\\nAAA Development Costs Balloon — AAA game development costs continue to grow year-over-year. Most recently court filings leaked that 2020’s The Last of Us Part II had a budget of $220M. (Source: VentureBeat)\\nWith such high development costs, executives focused on games for their known core market – mostly teenage boys – and wouldn’t take creative risks on development games for other diverse audiences. Two forces bucked that trend: modularization and UGC.\\n2) Modularization: Refocusing on Gameplay\\nMonolith development first began to change with the growth of licensed game engines–first id Software’s Doom and Quake Engines and then Epic Games’ Unreal Engine and Unity. These off-the-shelf engines abstracted the creation of the environments that games lived in and sped up the development process in the industry through strong network effects: developers versed in a popular engine used in one game could easily re-use that knowledge in developing another.\\nThis initial wave of modularization of the game development stack–mostly in the early 2000s–saw the rise of indie game developers as we know them today. Game infrastructure improvements on the development-front like Adobe Flash and GameMaker Studio and the distribution-front like Steam and XBox Live. These tools together allowed smaller developer teams to build games efficiently while still reaching meaningful scale. Creating compelling game mechanics and assets became the focus, rather than developing the low-level systems to power their game environments or searching for a partner to publish their games to offset expanding development budgets. Modularization reduced costs through standardization of the game development stack.\\nWe believe the modular model and further standardization are here to stay as the benefits of modularization extend beyond increasing development speed and agility. By standardizing aspects of game development, we expect an increase in the pace of iteration and a growth in the scope of games per developer, especially in live-service formats.\\nVelocity of Creation and Iteration Will Drive Future Revenues — While the majority of revenues today are concentrated in traditional monolithic architectures (e.g. EA, Activision), increased efficiency in game creation will allow games to be closely tailored to player preferences. Revenue will likewise shift towards studios that iterate and adapt fastest. (Source: Lightspeed)\\nA second-wave of modularization has been underway for the past few years. Companies like Pragma, inspired by the success of engines like Unity and Unreal Engine, are building plug-and-play solutions for complex yet tedious aspects of the game backend including matchmaking, battle passes, and inventory management. Similarly, Hathora provides serverless hosting for multiplayer games so teams have less game launch anxiety. We think it’s critical for solutions to find the right balance between standardization and extensibility to be able to sell into both established AAA and up-and-coming studios.\\n3) UGC: The Player Creator\\nWhile modularization of the game development stack focuses on reducing the burden of creation for existing development teams, the rise of UGC brought non-developers into the game creation ecosystem by lowering the knowledge threshold.\\nUGC games have their roots in modding culture, which has always been integral to game fandom among technically-capable and deeply dedicated fans. Experimentation with mods has led to popular games like Dota 2 (Warcraft III) and Counterstrike (Half-Life) that developed gameplay and mechanics reused in other games (e.g. League of Legends and Valorant). Similarly, we expect that the continued growth of UGC is leading to a flood of new game concepts and mechanics that can be leveraged on or off those platforms.\\nModding has also been critical to growth strategies for game communities. For example, Maxis released modding toolkits for The Sims in 2000 before the game itself, in order to stimulate a community that increased the quantity of in-game assets. By allowing players to create specialized in-game assets, the game became both larger and more personalized. Perhaps more importantly, these toolkits and templates provided easier onramps for players to begin creating. Similarly, the extent of documentation and ease of use of UGC services like Roblox Studio has increased the top-of-the-funnel of future game developers and created a “developer flywheel” that encourages others to create games.\\nThe UGC Developer Flywheel — Unlike the traditional developer flywheel where game development is technically difficult and few players become developers, UGC makes game creation exceedingly easy. As more players experiment and create novel game experiences, other players are attracted to create as well. (Source: Lightspeed)\\nMore future developers mean even more unbounded experimentation and exploration of what games can be. Games were never intended for only one demographic; UGC began to unlock who games are made for and who makes them.\\n4) The Dawn of the AI-Powered Studio\\nGaming has always had a special relationship with cutting-edge AI: games simulate human life just as AI simulates human intelligence. For example, in 2001, Halo’s gameplay felt revolutionary because of the novelty of its enemy AI: unlike FPS games before, enemies wouldn’t just run at players. Instead, enemies had rudimentary personalities: elite troops knew to take cover when under fire and aggressively attack when their health was low. The improved AI created a more realistic simulation for players and deepened their engagement with the game.\\nBuilding on modularization in game development and the rise of UGC, AI is supercharging game studios by creating engines and tools sets that automate the tedious aspects of game development and allowing anyone to build high-quality games.

By acting as a multiplying force in the game development process, AI expands what is possible at any budget. (Source: Lightspeed)\\nWe are already seeing AI-based innovation in art and asset creation pipelines for games increasing the level of personalization in gaming and the speed of development. Hypothetic, Luma AI, and others are building a future for anyone to nearly instantly generate 3D objects and models from prompts and other images removing the traditional pain associated with concepting, moving from high-fidelity to low-fidelity models, UV unwrapping and texture baking.\\nOf course, the key to the creative possibility of these objects will be the production-ready granularity of the object’s hierarchy. For example, models will need to be able to generate a car, but also contain logic to be able to regenerate just the side mirrors. With an explosion of potential characters and objects resulting from AI, it will be critical for animation teams to deploy these at scale. Tools like Move.ai, Latent Technology, and others accelerate the most time-consuming and expensive aspects of motion capture, animation and rigging.\\nIn addition to object creation and animation, modular AI tools are being used to design game environments: Blockade Labs’ Skybox AI creates panoramic scenes from text-inputs. Importantly, these off-the-shelf asset creation tools can work alongside incumbent engines which are aiding in the discovery of these tools directly through storefronts like the Unity’s Asset Store.\\nAI will play an equally critical role in developer and mod tooling for the benefit of game teams alleviating some of the worst aspects of AAA’s crunch culture. Copiloting developer toolkits like those developed by incumbents like Unity or startups like Common Sense Machines and Rosebud AI will reduce the time required to write and deploy new code by translating natural language into 3D worlds and allowing for real-time ideation and iteration. In addition to creation, AI will also impact quality assurance and testing. Today, large teams of manual play testers often comprise as much as 10% of game development budgets. QA teams soon will be able to use tools like Agentic or modl.ai to improve their testing processes requiring less human time on the mundane aspects of testing and can instead focus on the quality of gameplay.\\nWhereas studios before would have to choose between creativity and efficiency, AI expands the possibilities frontier by obviating that tradeoff allowing pipelines to scale based on imagination rather than resources.\\nAI-Native Games: The New Paradigm in Player Experiences\\nWhile the preceding cost and efficiency improvements from AI adoption in game development are significant, we believe what makes AI highly potent for the gaming industry and what will unseat incumbents are the novel experiences that AI permits in games.

       "    'NPC появляются и исчезают, как того требуют механики игры, такие как развитие узла. [3] \\n Поведение NPC диктуются временем суток или другим циклом вращения, другие будут статичными. [4]   \\n  Там, где мы размещаем ротации NPC, которые имеют значение — это будут ротации, которые существуют, возможно, в течение часа, а не в течение дня, так сказать. Так что может быть пять минут смены прислужников организации в храме или где-то еще; и это может быть потому, что, очевидно, есть квест, связанный с этой ротацией.  [4]   – Steven Sharif   \\n  Элитный монстр 3D рендеринг. [5]     Это действительно большой чувак, идея стоящая за ним, заключается в том, что вы увидите больших монстров - я думаю, что рост персонажа достигает его локоть, или чуть ниже локтя, я не уверен, - но вы увидите эта большая элита как бы просто бродит по миру. Они не привязаны к какому-то конкретному охотничьему угодью, они просто бродят; и я думаю, что этот компонент довольно крут, особенно когда у вас есть открытый мир, где вы можете увидеть что-то уникальное, не похожее на монстров, на которых вы охотитесь в определенной области, а просто прогуливаясь мимо.   [5]   – Steven Sharif     \\n     \\nПо всему миру будет смесь разных монстров и уровней сложности, привязанных к развитию близлежащих узлов. По мере продвижения узлов мобы мобы будут представлять новые и возрастающие опасности, в которых могут участвовать игроки. [8] \\n  Естественно, в мире будут локации со смешанным уровнем монстров различной сложности; таблицы появления монстров будут зависеть от уровня развития соседних узлов. По мере развития узла, будут меняться таблицы появления монстров вокруг, чтобы отразить их развитие в мире, предоставляя новые, более трудные опасности, которым игроки смогут бросить вызов  [8]   – Steven Sharif   \\n Будут летающие мобы, но не с точки зрения необходимости летающего маунта, чтобы с ними сразиться.. [9]   \\n  У нас будут летающие монстры, но, по сути, это означает, что либо в дереве поведения будут повороты, которые могут сделать их недоступными для целей, либо они могут делать что-то вроде пикирующих атак; они могут прилететь, приземлиться на землю и сразиться с вами. Но, как правило, монстры будут доступны с земли, поэтому мы не создаем контент для ограниченного числа людей, которые будут иметь доступ к летающему маунту.  [9]   – Steven Sharif   \\n Определенные элитные монстры, не закрепленные за какими-либо конкретными охотничьими угодьями, бродят по всему миру. [5]  Другие мобы будут иметь дистанцию сброса агро, что заставит монстра вернуться на место, если он убежит слишком далеко. [10]   \\n   Механика сброса агро немаловажна. Существуют внутриигровые последствия, которые случаются, когда вам дается возможность двигать популяции. Мы не хотим, чтобы игроки принимали это в расчёт.  [10]   – Steven Sharif   \\n   Типы неигровых персонажей \\n  Agricultural supplies merchants   Animated Armor Mobs   Arachnids   Beetles   Black market vendors   Боссы   Caravan masters   Commodities vendors   Construction foreman   Cyclops   Demons   Dragons   Elder dragons   Батраки и НИПы-помощники   Haunted Armor   Hired NPCs   Living statues   Mercenary NPCs   Merchants   Minotaurs   Монстры   Mushroom (mobs)   Грибы   NPC guards   Najash   Naval NPCs   Player stall NPCs   Priests   Profession NPCs   Quest givers   Raptors   Requisition agents   Scholars   Scorpions   Siege NPCs   Skeletons   Spirits   Stoneworks merchants   Tavern NPCs   Undead   War Beast   Woodshop merchants   Zombies  \\n NPC variants \\n     \\n     \\nThere will be variants of the monthly cosmetics for Неигровые персонажи and Монстры. [12]   [13] \\n  We\\'ve mentioned this before about what the cosmetics do, but all of those pre-order pack items allow us to create the world. They\\'re the NPCs in the world. They help us make NPC variants. The clothing and costumes are costumes that we\\'ll be putting on NPCs. You\\'re actually helping us create the world.  [14]   – Margaret Krohn   \\n   Расы неигровых персонажей \\n     \\n  Cyclops   Друиды   Гоблины   Minotaurs   Najash   Долинники   Древние   Тренты   Тролли  \\n   Взаимодействие с расами неигровых персонажей \\n Неигровые персонажи будут по-разному реагировать на разные метки персонажа. [16] \\n К примеру, неигровые персонажи-эльфы будут общаться с людьми иначе, нежели с эльфами. [16]   \\n   Языки неигровых персонажей \\nThe race of a NPC influences its language and nomenclature in terms of its dialogue tree. [17] \\n Hired NPCs \\n     \\n Hired NPCs are able to be utilized for specific functions. [19]   [20]   [21]   [22]   [23]   [24]   [25]   [26]   [27]   [28]   [29] \\n Node-related NPCs \\n Higher tier node NPCs (such as NPC guards) may be available when certain service buildings (such as the barracks) is upgraded by the mayor, or when the node achieves certain relics, or specific node policies are enacted. [30]   [31]   [32]   [33]  \\n Mercenary NPCs can also be hired ahead of certain events. [30]   \\n Player-hired NPCs \\n NPCs that exist on freeholds may be available when certain freehold buildings are upgraded relating to artisan progression. [32] \\n There will be different costs associated with hiring higher tier NPC assistants. [32]    \\nNPCs hired by players are able to be customized via the character creator. Node-related NPCs are not able to be customized. [31]   [34]   \\n  Those are specific types of NPCs that have specific functions; and for example, on the freehold, we\\'ve always talked about in the past having certain NPCs that are capable of rotating crops or planting and/or watering, doing certain process-oriented functions that are available to the user to acquire. We still have those plans. Those plans will follow a similar pet system functionality, core system functionality, where they\\'ll have actions that can be dictated by the user.  [19]   – Steven Sharif   \\n  Q: How advanced is it going to be? How advanced is going to be the system of hiring and customizing?  \\n  A: Relatively advanced. I think there\\'s a few paths that you can take when it comes to training up those types of NPC aids. What things that they can do. I think there\\'s going to be different tiers and costs associated with higher level assistance on the freehold. But the same is true for mercenaries that nodes can hire, or castles can place with regards to sieges and/or wars and/or events. Like you have a very base functioning level of mercenaries with set of equipment and skill rotations and behavior trees that are possible at a fundamental level. And then as you upgrade the node\\'s barracks, as you might upgrade- you might achieve certain Relics that you gain or enact certain policies that allow you to dial up the stats of those mercenaries. The same thing is true for the NPCs that can exist on freeholds, except those might be more predicated to service buildings that relate to artisanship. And that might be one of the reasons why it\\'s beneficial to own a freehold in one particular node versus another- is based off of what amenities are now available to your freehold as a result of that node selection.  [32]   – Steven Sharif   \\n List of hired NPCs \\n  Батраки и НИПы-помощники   Mercenary NPCs   NPC guards   Player stall NPCs   Tavern NPCs  \\n Farmhand NPCs \\nВ зависимости от типа узла и его уровня развития, игроки смогут нанимать НИПов для работы в качестве батраков на фермах, расположенных на наделах. Игроки смогут руководить батраками как в игре в режиме онлайн, так и в режиме оффлайн через приложение (мобильное) или веб-интерфейс. [29]   [28] \\n Управление ротацией посевов.\\nПосадка или сбор определённых посевов.\\nПродажа пищи или собранных посевов. \\n Mercenary NPCs \\n     \\n Mercenary NPCs can be hired to participate in node and castle sieges. [36]   [22]   [23]   [24] \\n Varying tiers of mercenary NPCs may be unlocked based on the investment made in their progression. Highest tier NPC mercenaries are referred to as heros. [37]   [38]   [22]   [23] \\n  Mayors are able to allocate treasury funding to hire mercenary NPCs to defend their node during sieges. [23]   [24]  \\nNodes can invest in upgrade paths that give a greater selection of roles and quality (gear level) of NPC mercenaries used for caravan defense. [37]  \\nNPC mercenaries can be hired to participate in castle sieges based on the allocation made by the governing castle and how successful they have been defending their castle nodes. [38]   [22]  \\nThese mechanics are subject to change based on testing and priorities. [37]   [38]     \\n Neither player or NPC mercenaries are present node wars. [36]   [39]   \\n Players can assign mercenary NPCs, but won\\'t micromanage them, in a similar manner to pets. [24]   \\n  There are mercenary NPCs that can be assigned to players. We\\'ve discussed about that before and those will follow generically... a pet system even adopted majority of the pet system with the added bonus of objective based points of interest that you can assign them to. But we don\\'t want to inundate the field with these mercenaries they\\'ll be few and far between. They\\'ll be assigned specifically like let\\'s say for example as the mayor of a node during a siege you\\'ll be able to assign these two specific players that are citizens within your node and then they\\'ll have those they\\'ll spawn during the during the node siege; or vice versa and the castle siege guild leaders can assign mercenaries that are available based on the progress of those subsidiary nodes around the castle siege whether or not you have those available to your defense or your attack.  [24]   – Steven Sharif   \\n Tavern NPCs \\n        The way that the tavern NPCs are going to work is you\\'ll have patrons of either in-node taverns that will have the ability to list items as part of that NPC\\'s merchant store and those items will mainly be around food and drink; and those types of craftable things that are relevant to these taverns; and those items will grant buffs based on proximity. And then additionally players can build taverns on their freeholds- we\\'ve discussed this in the past- they will list their craftable foods and drinks and whatnot with their NPC at that tavern as well; and players who interact with that can purchase them- have a drink at the tavern, eat some food at the tavern; and that\\'ll give them a buff for a period of time as long as they remain proximity of that freehold.  [20]   – Steven Sharif     \\n Tavern NPCs (\"bartenders\") are merchants that are present in Taverns in nodes and on freeholds. [20]   [25] \\n Tavern NPCs sell food, drinks, and other crafted items that have been made for that tavern. Consuming these items will grant buffs for a period of time, providing the character remains in proximity to the tavern. [20]   [25]   \\n  You\\'re going to probably want to sell items to other players more than necessarily tavern merchants but they\\'ll be there as well.  [20]   – Jeffrey Bard   \\n Player stall NPCs \\n Attendant NPCs may assigned to occupy a player stall while that player is not online. [21]   [26]   [27] \\n Player stall NPCs may be an \"image\" of the player. [40]   \\n   Репутация \\nХорошие действия, такие как участие в строительстве цивилизации, могут привести к тому, что этот персонаж получит положительную репутацию Узла. Предпринятые плохие действия, такие как провал определенных квестов, могут привести к получению отрицательной репутации. Эта репутация приобретается или теряется в зависимости от узла. [41] \\n  Неигровые персонажи могут по-разному реагировать на игроков в зависимости от их репутации узла. [41]   [42] \\n Это может привести к более высоким ценам (для товаров или услуг, продаваемых в этом узле). [41]  \\n NPC-охранники будут убивать коррумпированных игроков на месте. [43]  \\nNPCдобавят игрока в свой список ненависти, если этот игрок исцеляет, усиливает или иным образом помогает любому игроку в их списке ненависти. [44]    \\nОтрицательная репутация также может открывать определенные линии квестов в которых заинтересованы более темная и захудалая сторона мира. [41]  \\nЧрезмерно отрицательная репутация может привести к тому, что персонаж будет считаться «врагом государства» узла. [41] \\n  Мэры также могут объявлять иностранных граждан других узлов врагами государства. [45]   [46]     \\n  Чем больше задач, связанных с добрым мировоззрением или строительством цивилизации, которые вы выполняете, тем выше положительная репутация. Но если у вас низкая или плохая репутация, вы можете считаться врагом государства узла. Вас могут счесть плохим игроком, и это может повысить цены для вас, но это также может открыть определенные линии квестов, в которых заинтересованы более темная, более захудалая сторона мира.   [41]   – Steven Sharif   \\n   Восприятие со стороны неигровых персонажей \\n     \\nДля разных NPC существуют разные режимы восприятия. [47] \\n NPC в определённых столкновениях могут знать о своей локальной среде и могут, например искать укрытие за препятствиями; но это не будет распространено в общих конструкциях AI. [48]   \\n  Одна из лучших систем была реализована в Final Fantasy 11, где было обоняние, зрение и магия. Было множество различных вещей, от которых нужно было защищаться, чтобы определённые мобы не могли вас увидеть; можно было поддерживать эту способность, чтобы легко проскочить мимо... Это делало тех монстров уникальными и придавало им характерные особенности помимо того, сколько урона они могли нанести.  [47]   – Jeffrey Bard   \\n   Озвучка \\nУ НИП будут озвученные приветствия. [49]   [50] \\n  Цепочек заданий с озвучкой закадрового текста на данный момент не планируется. [49]  \\nДобавление озвучивания в игру на более поздних этапах - достаточно косметическое изменение. [49]   \\n  Трудно ли будет добавить позже озвучивание? Нет, определённо нет... это достаточно косметическое изменение.  [49]   – Steven Sharif   \\n  Озвучка это забавная роскошь, но она не только дорогая, но и требует много логистики.  [51]   – Steven Sharif   \\n   Искусственный интеллект \\n      Джермейн Тормент из Иллвинда босс моб. [52]     Вы можете видеть, как мы используем некоторые из различных частей доспехов — вы, вероятно, видели некоторые из этих частей на разных нарядах, таких как плащ Корвида Карателя на нем.  [52]   – Margaret Krohn     \\n Ashes of Creation используется адаптивный искусственный интеллект (ИИ), а это означает, что разные встречи с похожими существами принесут разный опыт игрокам. [53] \\n Использование новой технологии искусственного интеллекта, которой не было в других проектах MMORPG. [54]  \\n Боссы написаны по сценарию и динамически принимают решения во время сражений. [55]  \\nРазработчики обсуждали NPC, выполняющих «праздные действия», чтобы сделать мир более живым, но это не подтверждено. [56]  \\nНекоторые варианты поведения ИИ могут активироваться в зависимости от прогресса в столкновении. [57] \\n Более высокая частота AoE-атак в зависимости от количества участвующих игроков. [57]  \\nРазблокируйте ярость, эффекты восстановления и положительные эффекты. [57]  \\nДополнительные дополнения и дополнительные классы. [57]    \\n NPC в определенных встречах могут знать о своем окружении и, например, искать укрытия за препятствиями; но это не будет преобладать в общем дизайне ИИ. [48]   \\nСуществуют системы ИИ которые не относятся к управлению NPC. [58] \\n  Продвижение узлов. [58]  \\n Фондовый рынок. [58]  \\n Запущенные события. [58]   \\n  Существуют некоторые дополнительные параметры ИИ, которые устанавливаются, но не обязательно связаны с управлением NPC. Есть ИИ в отношении развития границ для узлов в направлении, а также решений, которые принимаются о том, какие нижние узлы поработить в качестве вассальных государств. Есть ИИ, связанный с небольшим количеством фондового рынка, который будет присутствовать в экономике. Есть несколько систем ИИ, которые будут анонсированы, которые являются довольно инновационными, я думаю, в отношении жанра MMORPG, и это сделает систему срабатывания событий очень интересной, я думаю; и это в отношении того, как узлы развиваются, и окружающая среда реагирует на это развитие, порождая эти срабатывающие события, такие как орда зомби, атакующая город, или легендарный рейд-босс, выходящий из горы. Я думаю, что в Ashes есть много возможностей для внедрения инноваций, которые были в секторе ИИ в разработке игр.

       "    'The MMORPG gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.5% during the forecast period of 2021-2026. The increasing trend for online gaming among millennials has led to the creation of a virtual world for video gamers, where they get a virtual economy, currency, trade environment, and real-time scenarios to deal with. The increasing gaming player bases, revenues, and investment in the gaming market across the globe are also aiding the growth of the MMORPG gaming market. Key Highlights  The increasing penetration of the internet is boosting the growth of MMORPG gaming across the world. Access to the internet in developing economies such as India and Brazil, among other countries, is aiding internet users\\' growth. According to the India Brand Equity Foundation, internet penetration in India accounted for 50% in February 2020 from 4% in 2007. Also, according to the data of GlobalWebIndex, it indicates that more than 1 billion people worldwide are now interested in internet streaming each month. With the help of advanced gaming technology, the game developers successfully keep the gamers engaged in the role-playing games and encourage them to stake more real money to receive the benefits or \"boosters\" over the games. This strategy has also facilitated the MMORPG game publishers and developers to generate more sales by retaining players and attracting others. According to the Enterprise Software Association, almost 50% of gamers have made a microtransaction in the past year. Among the various gaming platforms, the gaming console is also expected to witness considerable growth during the forecast period in the MMORPG market, owing to increasing gaming subscriptions among the players, increasing adoption of sport, and video game advertising. The rise of video games through consoles is growing and might show potential growth in the coming years. As a response to this trend, connectivity and entertainment providers could target the console gamers by offering console-related video services, such as live sports, fast broadband, and monetizing the audience more optimally through OTT ad-supported services. North America is expected to be the fastest-growing market for MMORPG gaming due to a significant rise in gaming across the United States and Canada population. According to the Enterprise Software Association, 60% of Americans play video games daily, and 56% of gamers play multiplayer games at least once a week. Over 30% of consumers pay for gaming subscription services. The gaming ecosystem in the region is witnessing the increasing adoption of direct-to-consumer subscription services from technology enabling companies. With an outbreak of the COVID-19, the market witnessed a positive growth with the increasing popularity of online multiplayer games, as people stayed at home for the maximum time, due to lockdowns being imposed by various governments as well as to stay safe from being affected. Mobile platform is witnessing a significant increase in consumer engagement with mobile-based gaming, especially in mobile-first markets, such as Asia, Middle East, and Latin America. According to Verizon, the usage of gaming apps rose 75% week-over-week during April 2020 and is expected to increase further.    Mobile Platform is Expected to Grow at a Considerable Rate   A mobile platform, such as smartphone gaming has been exploded in the past couple of years. There were more than 213 million mobile game players in 2020 in the United States alone. This growing demand for mobile-based gaming is a direct result of the multiple technological advancements in the market, such as AR, VR, cloud gaming, and 5G. This trend is not surprising considering that the mobile gaming platform industry primarily relies on new technology. Another trend in the market includes the rise of the hyper-casual game genre.\\u200b The smartphone gaming platform is witnessing rapid growth and is representing a cost-effective opportunity for investors, mobile developers, and publishers. It is also anticipated that by 2021, the number of mobile online gamers in the Southeast Asian region would rise to 250 million. The release of 5G and unlimited data plans is also expected to be key factors toward the success of cloud gaming globally, as most gamers currently are preferring games on mobile devices. The increasing services and investment in 5G infrastructure are also vital toward this success. According to Ericsson, the number of 5G mobile subscriptions in the Asia-Pacific region is anticipated to reach around 1,545 million by 2025.\\u200b Various MMORPG games are being provided in the android platform that is expected to gain significant traction in the mobile-based gaming platform in the forecasted period. People prefer more paid application MMORPG games on the Andriod platform. For instance, old-school RuneScape for mobile devices has gained a lot of traction and is one of the best MMORPG on Mobile, where charges range from USD 10.99 per month to USD 99.99 per year. While there are multiple gaming options available for smartphones, the size of the screen might be too limiting to get the immersive gaming experience. A gaming tablet has been an excellent product for consumers who want to enjoy games on the go. Tablet\\'s bigger screen, more battery life, and excellent processing power have been the most important factors for their growth in the market.   Latin America is Expected to Hold Significant Market Share   Latin America is one of the largest gaming markets with over 230 million gamers and growing at 13.5% a year. The number of gamers in Brazil and Mexico has passed those in Germany and the UK and shows no sign of slowing. Latin America isn\\'t just experiencing growth in the number of people playing video games. They are also developing their own games. For Instance, an indigenous game named \\'Argentum Online\\' became the first game in history which originated in Argentina and was able to have an Esports competition. The Argentum Cup was the first Esports tournament of the video game. The match began on 1st May 2021, and it was telecasted on the official Twitch channel of the event. The GSMA report, ‘The Mobile Economy Latin America 2020,” forecasts 62 million 5G connections across the region by 2025, representing a near 10% adoption rate. By that same year, 4G will account for 67% of total connections. 5G connection has higher speeds and ultra-low latency, which will make the gaming experience seamless and fuel the growth of the market studied. According to the Ministry of Culture Argentina, 60% of new smartphone users prefer playing games on smartphones. According to Adsmovil, there are 68.8% of adult mobile gamers in the country, and majorly, these are the primary audience for MMORPG gaming in the country. Moreover, during the COVID 19 pandemic number of mobile gamers are also increased due to the lockdown situation. Hence this considerable demand can create substantial market potential for the major vendors in this market. Brazil\\'s gaming industry is on the rise, with the potential to compete with other countries. Brazil\\'s gaming industry is enormous, with 75.7 million players and 59% of internet users watching gaming-related video content online. The country is second only to Mexico in Latin America, despite having 20 million more players, with an estimated revenue of USD 1.6 billion. Brazil has over 62 million active gamers, which is more than most major European markets have. In the past two years, the country\\'s gaming population increased by over 28%, in particular, because of the advancement of smartphone penetration and the popularity of mobile games. \\u200bTherefore, the penetration of smartphone and mobile gaming is expected to create significant opportunities for the market. According to China Link Trading, revenue generated on the smartphone/mobile platform in Brazil accounted for USD 533 million in 2020.   Competitive Landscape The MMORPG gaming market is fragmented in nature and comprises a large number of global and regional players. These players are majorly based in the Asia Pacific region and are focusing on expanding their consumer base. These gaming developers are investing more in the research and development activities to offer new solutions for gamers. The companies are also entering into strategic partnerships, and other organic &amp; inorganic growth strategies to earn a competitive edge.   July 2020 - Nexon Co.

Nearly a million more than the year prior. It’s been reported that  45%  of Gen Z are very or extremely likely to start their own business at some point in their life. Every year,  1.5 million  jobs are created by small businesses alone. \\nEvery entrepreneur starting a new business will have a unique goal, product or service, but what remains consistent is how important statistics can be. For SMBs and legacy companies alike, the way consumers want to interact with brands continues to evolve too. That’s why keeping tabs on the most updated business stats is so important. \\n Business stats help companies understand larger trends. This provides organizations with important industry intel to grow and scale.  \\nBusiness stats can be determined based on your specific market, company size, location…the list goes on. By having baseline stats to track performance, companies have a better understanding of what is going on in the larger industry opposed to just their company.\\n \\n \\n   \\n  22 business stats you should know in 2022\\n 63% of SMBs agree that automation helped their company pivot as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This could be starting an online business or simply changing up their existing model. (Zapier)  \\nIn recent years, sales tech has been seen as increasingly important. But within the past two years alone,  51%  of companies implemented new technologies to keep up with buyer demands. (Demandbase)  \\n  91%  believe that companies should fuel innovation by listening to buyers and customers directly. (SurveyMonkey)  \\nMore than  37% of buyers  say they are more conscious of the environmental impacts of their online shopping.  73%  of buyers expect online retailers to use recyclable or reduced packaging. (VentureBeat)  \\n  30%  of social media marketers plan to invest more in short-form video than any other social media marketing strategy in 2022 - and many are planning to use short-form video for the first time this year. (HubSpot)  \\nMore than  10%  of global mobile devices/connections will be 5G by next year. (Cisco)  \\nThe top channel marketers are planning to increase their usage of this year is TikTok.  62%  of those who use TikTok plan to increase their investment in 2022. (HubSpot)  \\nLinkedIn has experienced strong display ad sales - it is reported that they will cross the  $2 billion  threshold for B2B display ad revenue in 2023. (eMarketer)  \\nVP of Revenue Operations titles increased by  300%  on LinkedIn. (Clari)  \\n  97%  of top searches on Pinterest are completely unbranded. (Pinterest)  \\nU.S. podcast ad spend is expected to reach  $3 billion by 2026  . (eMarketer)  \\n  57%  of people that use the Internet say they will not recommend a business with a poorly designed website on a mobile device. (socPub)  \\nThe WordPress economy generates more than  half a trillion  in revenue. (WPEngine)  \\nPodcasts are effective.  20%  of people have bought something after hearing about it during a podcast.  65%  of people prefer listening to podcasts on a mobile device like a tablet or a phone. (Semrush).  \\nThe influencer marketing industry is expected to reach  $15B  by 2022. (The Drum)  \\n  4 out of 5  brands are using Instagram as a platform for influencer marketing. (Influencer Marketing Hub)  \\n  61%  of B2C marketers said they were planning to leverage influencer marketing in 2022. (HubSpot)  \\nIt’s been predicted that by 2024 consumer retail spend through chatbots will reach  $142 billion  globally.

(Insider Intelligence)  \\nAbout  70%  of consumers will buy from a brand based on their customer service - and nearly  80%  would switch to a competing brand if they had multiple negative experiences. (Oberlo)  \\n 80%  of consumers buy from brands that have core beliefs and values that align with their own. (KPMG)  \\n \\n    Why should businesses care about stats?\\nIn order for businesses of any type to be successful in the long term, they should fundamentally understand the art of adaptability. This is especially relevant today. HubSpot found that  99%  of content planners, strategists, or marketers who have ever pivoted their strategy say some of their pivots happened in 2021. By having industry wide business stats to point back to, companies will better understand how their performance is tracking compared to others. \\nWithout communication and alignment, even the best strategies will ultimately fall short. By creating a culture with transparency and constant knowledge sharing, organizations will eliminate silos. Sharing business stats is one key way to provide this type of information. \\n Business stats can help verify the effectiveness of a certain campaign, product launch or service.  \\nToday’s working environment is a lot different than it was a decade ago.  How we work  continues to change and evolve. In many industries, those that have been working remotely are not interested in returning to a traditional office environment every day. With team members located all around the world and in many cases, in multiple time zones, effective communication has become an even bigger priority. This is another important reason that sharing business stats on a regular basis keeps everyone aligned. \\nIt is crucial to understand which benchmarks are important, what’s changing and how they’re performing on a global scale.  \\n    How can you get the most out of business stats?\\nYou can get the most value out of business stats by sharing them with others. Whether it’s an internal team member, a peer you admire within your community, a customer or a partner - communicating business stats is another proof point for how your company is tracking towards specific goals. \\nBusiness stats are always changing. It is crucial to revisit stats to understand larger industry and market trends to see how areas of business transform over time. \\nHow companies leverage stats will vary for each and every organization. Generally speaking, business stats help organizations understand how they are performing in specific areas based on industry averages. Business stats can help a company establish new goals and potential opportunities for even more success in the future. \\nCompanies can use metrics to understand the areas they are exceeding goals, hitting goals and areas that still need work. Creating a culture with open lines of communication reduces silos and helps a company’s flywheel spin faster. \\nBest report resource in 2023. \\nLearn more about report to improve your e-commerce strategy.\\n20 Stats About Australian Instagram Users &amp; Trends\\n -\\nIn July, nearly 41% of Australia\\'s population was on Instagram.\\nTopics: yellow, users, instagram, media, sensis, social, report, million, australian, trends, stats, australia.\\n2021 Cyber Week Trends Report: BigCommerce Merchants Achieve Record Ecommerce Sales\\n -\\nFollowing a record-setting 2020 holiday season, the retail industry has been eagerly waiting to see how 2021 holiday ecommerce sales…\\nTopics: ecommerce, cyber, trends, holiday, achieve, record, shopping, customers, merchants, gmv, season, sales, bigcommerce, week, report.\\n5 Instagram Challenges Marketers are Facing, According to Research\\n -\\nInstagram likes to keep marketers on their toes.

Data management is mission-critical, however how brands deploy that data is changing at an accelerated pace.\\nElastic Path is recognized in the guide as a select vendor of PIM software. The research and insights are compiled in the Gartner 2022 Market Guide for PIM Solutions.\\nA Comprehensive Guide to eCommerce PIM Solutions for Decision Makers\\nGartner developed the guide for companies embarking on changes to their current solutions based on product information management trends. Its content educates and informs data and analytics leaders like you on how to pick the best PIM for eCommerce based on your business needs, so you are consistently managing and optimizing product information.\\nInclusion and Evaluation Criteria\\nGartner does the research so you hit the ground running on RFP and vendor selection. You get a global overview of the market players based on specific criteria.\\nGartner typically limits their inclusion criteria to a set number of vendors, a revenue threshold in dollars, and product availability on more than one continent. As for evaluation, Gartner makes an assessment of the different vendor offerings based on general criteria such as global viability, client experience, marketing strategy, revenue, and revenue growth. For each offer, the criteria are ranked and weighted according to their importance for Gartner at a High, Medium, or Low levels.\\nThe process is no ordinary selection process. Gartner provides a thorough, rigorous review of who is in the market, what they offer, and how well they are performing. To be included in the guide means a company is differentiating and leading in the market as a PIM solution. The next choice is yours given which of them provides the best solution for your needs.\\nClosing the Loop on the Product Content Life Cycle\\nLet’s begin with the basics of Product Information Management (PIM), or what Gartner refers to as the value delivered from a PIM:\\nThe ultimate purpose of PIM is to speed up your time to market, improve all aspects of sales, and deliver compelling product experiences across any touchpoint.\\nRegardless of what channel you’re selling in, PIM provides the foundation for customer experiences using relevant product information across touchpoints, and is especially crucial when enabling a digital eCommerce strategy.\\nPIM enabled eCommerce allows your brand story to be told with a single source of product truth without silos; sales, merchandising, marketing teams have access to and are empowered to build off the data.\\nEnter PXM, a Crux of One of Gartner\\'s Predictions for 2025\\nProduct Experience Management (PXM), is an arm of a broader approach to PIM for eCommerce. Working in tandem with PIM, PXM levels up the customer experience with analytical tools, such as Digital Shelf Analytics (DSA), machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The result is richer, more engaging customer experiences across touchpoints that support multiple use cases and product complexities.\\nFor channels that are long-term strategic investments, manual processes will eventually become insufficient. Instead, companies should invest in more robust product experience management (PXM) solutions, which represent an evolution beyond traditional PIM systems. PXM capabilities include automated rich content creation using natural language generation, AI-assisted rich content optimization and channel behavioral data, and DSA.\\nWhen referencing a “closed loop” , Gartner predicts that businesses adopting more robust PXM capabilities to enhance PIM will have greater leverage in building a revenue-generating, multichannel eCommerce solution. By gathering product information derived from PXM functionality, brands are now able to make changes and push those changes back out to their channels through syndication. The results? Product content optimization across every touchpoint and channel.\\nEP Product Experience Manager (PXM)\\nMerchandise Every Unique Product Experience, Without Custom Dev Work\\nGo to EP PXM\\nFurther Down the Road for Today’s Brands: Leveraging More Data\\nWhile Gartner points out in the report this practice rarely exists today, businesses will in the future tap into data from more resources than ever before such as existing PXM systems, point-of-sale in physical storefronts, and commerce platforms to further optimize across channels. The analyst notes that if the process happens today, the majority are performed with outdated PIM solutions. Within the report is a helpful visual tool as you envision the product data supply chain and how PIM affects the ecosystem: p&gt;\\nTerms to Note\\nWorth mentioning among this cavalcade of acronyms, are two I am highlighting from the report with additional explanation:\\nDigital Asset Management (DAM) - A single source of truth for all digital assets including video, audio, presentations, media files, and animations to name a few. Housing these assets in a centralized location streamlines brand identity and consistency, enabling automatic asset updates. It also streamlines content repurposing which is fast becoming key to a brand’s social media presence and social commerce strategy.\\nMaster Data Management (MDM) - As businesses increasingly went digital there was a rush to adopt Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), but that became somewhat limiting when businesses were faced with multiple use cases. MDM emerged as the answer to building a better beast; housing unified data across tools, systems, and locations to form a single source of truth.\\nElastic Path Product Experience Manager (EP PXM)\\nGood news for organizations of all sizes embarking on today’s complex and competitive commerce landscape: aligning with Gartner’s predictions and recommendations for the future state, is a product designed for your success: EP PXM.\\nEP PXM combines re-imagined eCommerce PIM software, Product Merchandising, and Catalog Composer capabilities into one central place for merchandisers to create the complex product experiences that keep your brand front and center in the eyes of increasingly demanding customers.\\nThe market guide references supportive PIM functionalities vendors provide that fall outside traditional core capabilities, such as supplier data onboarding, content optimization, and print publishing.\\nTwo standouts mentioned within the guide where EP PXM differentiates are product variant management and catalog creation. The product is designed with the merchandiser in mind with the ability to manage thousands of SKUs and multiple catalogs. In fact, EP PXM is the ideal solution for companies with “multis”: multiple brands, channels, geos, and use cases.\\nAs those sought after, hyper-personalized customer experiences become critical to your brand’s growth and reputation, this is the PIM game changer.

You will want to confirm your chosen commerce solution has the high security standards in place to ensure that your systems and data are kept secure. Fail to do this, and you could end up with security compromises like a data breaches or system intrusions, hurting your company’s reputation, customer loyalty, and jeopardizing revenue.\\nSecurity assessments like the SOC 2 evaluation provide a comprehensive and centralized, third party report to ensure you’re working with a vendor that has validated they follow the highest standards of security practices, policies, procedures, and operations. SOC 2 compliances reduces time spent on security evaluations and provides the confidence that your data is secure so you can launch and drive revenue faster while keeping your business operating at 100%.\\nFamiliarize yourself with SOC 2 with the top five questions we hear from prospects:\\nWhat does SOC 2 Compliance mean?\\nSOC stands for System and Organizational Controls and is based on the Trust Services Criteria. This criteria is focused on the ability to report on the design of controls (and/or testing and operating effectiveness of those controls) for a service organization. The SOC 2 report addresses an organization’s controls pertaining to operations and compliance standards; things like security, integrity, availability, privacy, and confidentiality are all aspects of SOC2.\\nWhy is it important to be SOC 2 compliant?\\nSOC 2 is an auditing procedure that ensures service providers securely manage data to protect the interests of organizations and the privacy of its clients. If your chosen commerce partner is SOC 2 compliant it means you can trust that they will do everything possible to protect your data and systems.\\nWhat is the benefit to the customer for a vendor to be SOC 2 Compliant?\\nSaaS vendors in particular need to be SOC 2 compliant in many instances, especially when they sell to the enterprise. Enterprises are often beholden to a wide variety of security and compliance controls and being demonstrably SOC 2 examined as a vendor gives those enterprise customers the peace of mind they need to do business with Elastic Path.\\nWhat security practices and procedures are assessed during a SOC 2 Compliance evaluation?\\nSOC 2 evaluates the operational policies, communications, procedures, and monitoring concerning four Trust Service Categories (TSC):\\nSecurity – Information and systems are protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical), unauthorized disclosure, and damage\\nAvailability – Information and systems are available for operation and use as committed\\nProcessing integrity – System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized\\nConfidentiality – Confidential information is secured, and access is controlled\\nWhat are the principles of SOC 2?\\nElastic Path utilizes independent third-party auditors to test the Elastic Path Commerce Cloud platform against the widely accepted security standards controls of SOC 2. These examinations are conducted by a respected audit and security firm that is independent and thorough in its inspections. The SOC2 examination report is intended to meet the needs of a broad range of users that need detailed information and assurance about the controls at a service organization relevant to the security, availability, and processing integrity of the systems the service organization uses to process data. With Elastic Path successfully achieving the SOC2 examination, we can ensure peace of mind to our customers.\\nLearn more about how you can build your eCommerce vision with confidence by visiting our Trust page.\\nTopics: soc, questions, report, controls, path, security, systems, compliance, standards, trust, data, service.\\nTrend Report: This is What Will Matter for Small Businesses in 2022\\n -\\nOur Future of Commerce report has invaluable insights into what you should be focussing on in 2022 as a small business owner.

So what does that mean? Data management is mission-critical, however how brands deploy that data is changing at an accelerated pace. Elastic Path is recognized in the guide as a select vendor of PIM software. The research and insights are compiled in the Gartner 2022 Market Guide for PIM Solutions. A Comprehensive Guide to eCommerce PIM Solutions for Decision Makers Gartner developed the guide for companies embarking on changes to their current solutions based on product information management trends. Its content educates and informs data and analytics leaders like you on how to pick the best PIM for eCommerce based on your business needs, so you are consistently managing and optimizing product information. Inclusion and Evaluation Criteria Gartner does the research so you hit the ground running on RFP and vendor selection. You get a global overview of the market players based on specific criteria. Gartner typically limits their inclusion criteria to a set number of vendors, a revenue threshold in dollars, and product availability on more than one continent. As for evaluation, Gartner makes an assessment of the different vendor offerings based on general criteria such as global viability, client experience, marketing strategy, revenue, and revenue growth. For each offer, the criteria are ranked and weighted according to their importance for Gartner at a High, Medium, or Low levels. The process is no ordinary selection process. Gartner provides a thorough, rigorous review of who is in the market, what they offer, and how well they are performing. To be included in the guide means a company is differentiating and leading in the market as a PIM solution. The next choice is yours given which of them provides the best solution for your needs. Closing the Loop on the Product Content Life Cycle Let’s begin with the basics of Product Information Management (PIM), or what Gartner refers to as the value delivered from a PIM: The ultimate purpose of PIM is to speed up your time to market, improve all aspects of sales, and deliver compelling product experiences across any touchpoint. Regardless of what channel you’re selling in, PIM provides the foundation for customer experiences using relevant product information across touchpoints, and is especially crucial when enabling a digital eCommerce strategy. PIM enabled eCommerce allows your brand story to be told with a single source of product truth without silos; sales, merchandising, marketing teams have access to and are empowered to build off the data. Enter PXM, a Crux of One of Gartner\\'s Predictions for 2025 Product Experience Management (PXM), is an arm of a broader approach to PIM for eCommerce. Working in tandem with PIM, PXM levels up the customer experience with analytical tools, such as Digital Shelf Analytics (DSA), machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The result is richer, more engaging customer experiences across touchpoints that support multiple use cases and product complexities. For channels that are long-term strategic investments, manual processes will eventually become insufficient. Instead, companies should invest in more robust product experience management (PXM) solutions, which represent an evolution beyond traditional PIM systems. PXM capabilities include automated rich content creation using natural language generation, AI-assisted rich content optimization and channel behavioral data, and DSA. When referencing a “closed loop” , Gartner predicts that businesses adopting more robust PXM capabilities to enhance PIM will have greater leverage in building a revenue-generating, multichannel eCommerce solution. By gathering product information derived from PXM functionality, brands are now able to make changes and push those changes back out to their channels through syndication. The results? Product content optimization across every touchpoint and channel. EP Product Experience Manager (PXM) Merchandise Every Unique Product Experience, Without Custom Dev Work Go to EP PXM Further Down the Road for Today’s Brands: Leveraging More Data While Gartner points out in the report this practice rarely exists today, businesses will in the future tap into data from more resources than ever before such as existing PXM systems, point-of-sale in physical storefronts, and commerce platforms to further optimize across channels. The analyst notes that if the process happens today, the majority are performed with outdated PIM solutions. Within the report is a helpful visual tool as you envision the product data supply chain and how PIM affects the ecosystem: p> Terms to Note Worth mentioning among this cavalcade of acronyms, are two I am highlighting from the report with additional explanation: Digital Asset Management (DAM) - A single source of truth for all digital assets including video, audio, presentations, media files, and animations to name a few. Housing these assets in a centralized location streamlines brand identity and consistency, enabling automatic asset updates. It also streamlines content repurposing which is fast becoming key to a brand’s social media presence and social commerce strategy. Master Data Management (MDM) - As businesses increasingly went digital there was a rush to adopt Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), but that became somewhat limiting when businesses were faced with multiple use cases. MDM emerged as the answer to building a better beast; housing unified data across tools, systems, and locations to form a single source of truth. Elastic Path Product Experience Manager (EP PXM) Good news for organizations of all sizes embarking on today’s complex and competitive commerce landscape: aligning with Gartner’s predictions and recommendations for the future state, is a product designed for your success: EP PXM. EP PXM combines re-imagined eCommerce PIM software, Product Merchandising, and Catalog Composer capabilities into one central place for merchandisers to create the complex product experiences that keep your brand front and center in the eyes of increasingly demanding customers. The market guide references supportive PIM functionalities vendors provide that fall outside traditional core capabilities, such as supplier data onboarding, content optimization, and print publishing. Two standouts mentioned within the guide where EP PXM differentiates are product variant management and catalog creation.

The SOC 2 report addresses an organization’s controls pertaining to operations and compliance standards; things like security, integrity, availability, privacy, and confidentiality are all aspects of SOC2.

If your chosen commerce partner is SOC 2 compliant it means you can trust that they will do everything possible to protect your data and systems. What is the benefit to the customer for a vendor to be SOC 2 Compliant? SaaS vendors in particular need to be SOC 2 compliant in many instances, especially when they sell to the enterprise. Enterprises are often beholden to a wide variety of security and compliance controls and being demonstrably SOC 2 examined as a vendor gives those enterprise customers the peace of mind they need to do business with Elastic Path.

What are Market Research Services?\\nMany businesses turn to market research services to help them gain a deeper understanding of market trends and factors that contribute to business growth. These insights are then used to help businesses reach their marketing goals more efficiently, elevate their brand, and better understand their surrounding market. In addition to gaining market insights, companies can utilize this type of research to understand competitive trends, including what has and hasn’t been working.\\nWhen hired, research firms will usually provide custom markets reports consisting of qualitative and quantitative insights tailored to the company\\'s particular industry. These reports may either be for internal use only or be a public, external-facing report.\\nMarket research firms typically have a panel of consumers they can survey, interview, and collect other types of data from. Consumers are often compensated for participating in market research. They may either be paid directly by the market research firm or by the company that commissions the research.\\nMarket Research Services Features\\nMost market research service providers offer:\\nCustom research services\\nConsumer panels\\nMultiple sampling methods\\nQualitative research (interviews, focus groups)\\nQuantitative research (surveys, eye tracking)\\nSurvey design and fielding\\nResearch report writing\\nResearch report distribution\\nPre-written report purchasing\\nMultiple types of reports\\nConsumer reports\\nMarket size reports\\nMarket trends reports\\nReports for different market geos\\nMarket Research Services Comparison\\nBefore deciding on which market research firm to work with, consider some of the following factors:\\n Communication. Make sure that the market research firm you end up hiring has a good communication track record. Since they will be acting as your research business partner, it’s important that your business be kept in the loop about important findings and report timeline changes. Research past customer experiences to ensure you will feel comfortable in the partnership.\\n Size of Business. Some market research services are better equipped to perform custom research for very large markets. Others are better suited to researching niche or emerging markets.\\nPricing Information\\nDue to the unique nature and research needs of the business, pricing details are usually not publicly displayed. Contact the research firm directly to receive a customized quote. Most of the products will contain free trials of their services.\\n  Frequently Asked Questions     Why use market research services?    Market research services provide businesses with customized research that helps product insights about their specific market. This might include emerging trends, consumer preferences and opinions, or competitive intelligence and brand awareness. Depending on the research firm and the type of research being requested, these services may use qualitative or quantitative research methods (or a mixture of both).       What are the benefits of using market research services?    One large benefit of working with a market research firm is the ability to outsource research needs. This saves the business time and money that they would otherwise spend conducting research themselves. The insights the research produces can also help companies better understand their target market, how their market is changing, how they stack up against competitors, and their overall level of brand awareness in the market.       How much do market research services cost?    In order to obtain pricing, contact the vendor for quotes customized to your business’s research needs. Prices may vary depending on the type of research needed, the scope of the research, the number of consumer participants, and potentially other research factors. \\nFind Better Ideas, Faster ® with a business trend report, our PRO Dashboard and 80+ categories of premium trend reports.\\nGet a Custom Version of the Business Trend Report\\nThe Business Trend Report offers an insightful look into the business trends and market trends shaping today’s marketplace.
