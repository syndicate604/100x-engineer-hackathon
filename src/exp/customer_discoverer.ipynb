2026\\n\\nReport\\n\\n121 Pages\\nFebruary 2021\\nRegion: Global\\nMind Commerce\\nID: 5265110\\n1H FREE ANALYST TIME\\nDescription\\nTable of Contents\\nCompanies Mentioned\\nMethodology\\nRelated Topics\\nRelated Reports\\n\\nIdentify Leading Applications in the Consumer and Enterprise Virtual Reality Market\\n\\nThis report evaluates VR applications for the consumer and enterprise sectors for which we see gaming, education, and simulations training leading the way. The report assesses leading companies, strategies, products, and services. It provides analysis and forecasts for VR gaming, education, and simulations for 2021 through 2026.\\n\\n\\nSelect Report Findings:\\n\\n\\n5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming\\nFor training and instruction, we see everything from situational to more traditional expectations such as VR enhanced simulations for flight and vehicle training\\nVR solution-focused offerings will focus upon very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training\\nEdge computing will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases\\n\\nWe see fully immersive virtual reality systems gaining substantial market momentum in consumer markets within the next few years. These VR systems will provide an unprecedented digital experience for humans, often including multiple senses as well as interaction with virtual objects and/or interaction between the real and virtual worlds.\\n\\nIn terms of the consumer segment, we see current VR gaming evolving from current offerings such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PlayStation VR to more sophisticated entertainment that involves elements of casual gaming combined with real-world interests involving the economy and social status.\\n\\nIn many respects, VR gaming is a greenfield opportunity, which will bring many new market entrants into the fray as application and content providers aggressively compete to establish a loyal user base. For example, Skydance Interactive, a division of Skydance Media, has recently unveiled The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, initially available on Oculus Rift, Rift S, Quest, and HTC Vive.\\n\\nSuccessful companies will be those that develop communities of interest based on game-play and follower dynamics including innovation in interactive e-sports entertainment, in-game reward systems, and real-world to VR gamification integration. Long-term success will be dependent upon game delivery platform, system, and connectivity independence. This will occur coincident with a few key trends in platform/network transformation and service delivery such as the shift from console to cloud supported platforms and 5G communications supported by edge computing.\\n\\nSome very compelling enterprise VR applications are anticipated to emerge over the next three to five years. Many of these will be solution-focused upon achieving very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training. Enterprise applications will extend beyond internal use and B2B as businesses embrace the use of VR to reach consumer markets. Real estate is a prime example where VR may be used for education-sales such as training new home buyers while simultaneously marketing properties.\\n\\nWe see the virtual reality market gaining ground once 5G is more firmly in place commercially, but not entirely due to wireless VR. Instead, we see a massive build-out of broadband as a whole (due to competition from the 5G market) as one of the fundamental drivers for VR adoption. This will be driven in part by substantially greater availability of FTTX and HFC as well as greater bandwidth overall at lower costs.\\n\\n5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming. Previously encumbered by a combination of technology gaps and consumer readiness issues, the virtual reality market is poised for substantive global growth, providing abundant opportunities for service providers, content developers, and ecosystem component providers.\\n\\nWhile today many apps and services within the XR universe are very device-dependent and network constrained, convergence is on the horizon from a device perspective as well as substantial opportunities through untethering via 5G and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). MEC will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases. This will be particularly the case for VR portability, and to some extent, mobility to the extent that there is good 5G coverage.\\n\\nSubstantially lower latency facilitated by the combination of 5G and MEC will lead to many new and enhanced applications. For example, VR-based telepresence will ultimately become the norm, starting with private enterprise solutions and the SMB markets through the likes of Zoom.\\n\\nThrough Voice over 5G (Vo5G), there will also be support for Ultra High Definition (UHD) audio communications, streaming video, and ultra-clear voice communication for next-generation virtual reality applications and services.
