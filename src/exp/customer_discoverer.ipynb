In this work, we explore whether an artificial agent with embodied feedback in virtual reality (VR) can foster a situated learning experience. Previous works on computer-mediated feedback have shown that VR can foster oral presentation competence for preuniversity and junior undergraduates through delivering feedback. However, it is unclear how well the learning experiences are and how well students perceive an artificial coach in VR, especially for senior undergraduates and postgraduates seeking job and research opportunities. To inform the design of such a system, we conducted interviews with experts and observed real elevator pitches. We then designed a proof-of-concept VR coaching system with three embodied feedback strategies: immediate, after-action, and the combination of both. Through a between-subject experiment with 40 participants, we studied learners’ perceptions under the embodied feedback. We found that receiving embodied feedback can create a stronger sense of cognitive apprenticeship, i.e., coaching and helping from experts, and help improve the perception of the artificial agent and the effect of learning. We further investigated the pros and cons of different strategies and discussed room for improvement. \\nDownload PDF\\nHTML (experimental)  \\nVirtual reality (VR) and interactive 3D visualization systems have enhanced educational experiences and environments, particularly in complicated subjects such as anatomy education. VR-based systems surpass the potential limitations of traditional training approaches in facilitating interactive engagement among students. However, research on embodied virtual assistants that leverage generative artificial intelligence (AI) and verbal communication in the anatomy education context is underrepresented. In this work, we introduce a VR environment with a generative AI-embodied virtual assistant to support participants in responding to varying cognitive complexity anatomy questions and enable verbal communication. We assessed the technical efficacy and usability of the proposed environment in a pilot user study with 16 participants. We conducted a within-subject design for virtual assistant configuration (avatar- and screen-based), with two levels of cognitive complexity (knowledge- and analysis-based). The results reveal a significant difference in the scores obtained from knowledge- and analysis-based questions in relation to avatar configuration. Moreover, results provide insights into usability, cognitive task load, and the sense of presence in the proposed virtual assistant configurations. Our environment and results of the pilot study offer potential benefits and future research directions beyond medical education, using generative AI and embodied virtual agents as customized virtual conversational assistants.\\n \\nSubmission history  From: Vuthea Chheang [view email]   [v1] \\nThu, 29 Jun 2023 19:39:28 UTC (377 KB)\\n[v2]\\nWed, 24 Jan 2024 19:09:11 UTC (478 KB)\\n  ||||I|||| Skip to main content\\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, member institutions , and all contributors.

Tis study identifed six life adaptation themes for design and development (recognizing facial expressions, crossing the road, how to get lost, shopping, taking public transport, and job interview) and set the objectives, design principles, specifc content, teaching evaluation, and other aspects of virtual reality life adaptation course. Combined with the characteristics of virtual reality, the implementation suggestions and matters needing attention are put forward. Te results showed that, in the recognition of human facial expressions, 51 experts thought it was appropriate, 3 experts thought it needed to be modifed, and no expert thought it was inappropriate. On the topic of crossing the road, 46 experts thought it was appropriate, eight thought it needed to be modifed, and no expert thought it was inappropriate. On the theme of taking public transportation, 48 experts thought it was appropriate, 6 experts thought it needed to be modifed, and no expert thought it was inappropriate. For the three major topics of how to get lost, shopping, and job interview, 2-3 experts put forward diferent opinions and think that the topic is not appropriate mainly because the grade arrangement is not appropriate. Conclusion. Te VR-based curriculum for school life adaptation has been reviewed by experts and revised by researchers. It is scientifc, interesting, and operable, solves the teaching problems of life adaptation teachers, and provides a safe, reliable, and efective practice channel for students.\\nIntroduction\\nVirtual reality technology is one of the core contents of educational technology. Te fundamental diference between virtual reality technology and other teaching methods is that virtual reality technology breaks the traditional teaching mode of one-way knowledge teaching.

It provides abundant resources and convenient space for cultivating students\\' divergent thinking. It combines students\\' learning, practice, and self-test to form a vivid, lively, and active teaching method, which is beyond the reach of any traditional teaching method and method and has irreplaceable functions and efects [1]. Specifcally speaking, the frst is to have the special means of individualized teaching centered on students. Te computer can give the learning content, instructions and questions, and other teaching information and can analyze and evaluate the learning efect according to the diferent solutions of students so that each student can be in a conducive to their own learning environment, with appropriate speed and multiple ideas and ways to answer questions. Second, the teaching form of virtual reality can make students choose the learning content suitable for their own difculty and ease by observation and association according to their actual situation through a variety of sensory stimulation, so as to achieve the efect of teaching students in accordance with their aptitude. Tis way of learning provides students with a wider range of learning space and choice space and enhances their learning confdence. Tird, virtual reality technology has interactive or man-machine dialogue characteristics.\\nVirtual reality technology organically integrates teaching and practice so that students and computers are always in a series of alternating questioning and answering processes. In this kind of man-machine timely feedback dialogue process, students can be one or more, teaching mode can be diversifed, teaching methods can be arbitrary, teaching speed can be multicontrolled, students can ask a question, a question to practice, and the computer provides a problem to solve, a changeable training function. In the process of training, students come into contact with many situations, fnd many problems, and propose many schemes, which broaden their thinking [2].\\nVirtual reality technology can also organically combine text, graphics, images, sounds, and animations and present them in front of students from all angles.

This report evaluates VR applications for the consumer and enterprise sectors for which we see gaming, education, and simulations training leading the way. The report assesses leading companies, strategies, products, and services. It provides analysis and forecasts for VR gaming, education, and simulations for 2021 through 2026. Select Report Findings:   5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming For training and instruction, we see everything from situational to more traditional expectations such as VR enhanced simulations for flight and vehicle training VR solution-focused offerings will focus upon very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training Edge computing will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases  We see fully immersive virtual reality systems gaining substantial market momentum in consumer markets within the next few years. These VR systems will provide an unprecedented digital experience for humans, often including multiple senses as well as interaction with virtual objects and/or interaction between the real and virtual worlds. In terms of the consumer segment, we see current VR gaming evolving from current offerings such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PlayStation VR to more sophisticated entertainment that involves elements of casual gaming combined with real-world interests involving the economy and social status. In many respects, VR gaming is a greenfield opportunity, which will bring many new market entrants into the fray as application and content providers aggressively compete to establish a loyal user base. For example, Skydance Interactive, a division of Skydance Media, has recently unveiled The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners, initially available on Oculus Rift, Rift S, Quest, and HTC Vive. Successful companies will be those that develop communities of interest based on game-play and follower dynamics including innovation in interactive e-sports entertainment, in-game reward systems, and real-world to VR gamification integration. Long-term success will be dependent upon game delivery platform, system, and connectivity independence. This will occur coincident with a few key trends in platform/network transformation and service delivery such as the shift from console to cloud supported platforms and 5G communications supported by edge computing. Some very compelling enterprise VR applications are anticipated to emerge over the next three to five years. Many of these will be solution-focused upon achieving very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training. Enterprise applications will extend beyond internal use and B2B as businesses embrace the use of VR to reach consumer markets. Real estate is a prime example where VR may be used for education-sales such as training new home buyers while simultaneously marketing properties. We see the virtual reality market gaining ground once 5G is more firmly in place commercially, but not entirely due to wireless VR. Instead, we see a massive build-out of broadband as a whole (due to competition from the 5G market) as one of the fundamental drivers for VR adoption. This will be driven in part by substantially greater availability of FTTX and HFC as well as greater bandwidth overall at lower costs. 5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming. Previously encumbered by a combination of technology gaps and consumer readiness issues, the virtual reality market is poised for substantive global growth, providing abundant opportunities for service providers, content developers, and ecosystem component providers. While today many apps and services within the XR universe are very device-dependent and network constrained, convergence is on the horizon from a device perspective as well as substantial opportunities through untethering via 5G and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). MEC will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases. This will be particularly the case for VR portability, and to some extent, mobility to the extent that there is good 5G coverage. Substantially lower latency facilitated by the combination of 5G and MEC will lead to many new and enhanced applications. For example, VR-based telepresence will ultimately become the norm, starting with private enterprise solutions and the SMB markets through the likes of Zoom. Through Voice over 5G (Vo5G), there will also be support for Ultra High Definition (UHD) audio communications, streaming video, and ultra-clear voice communication for next-generation virtual reality applications and services. Vo5G will benefit VR for consumer and enterprise applications in many respects such as UHD becoming the norm in immersive experiences.

This report evaluates VR applications for the consumer and enterprise sectors for which we see gaming, education, and simulations training leading the way. The report assesses leading companies, strategies, products, and services. It provides analysis and forecasts for VR gaming, education, and simulations for 2021 through 2026. Select Report Findings:   5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming For training and instruction, we see everything from situational to more traditional expectations such as VR enhanced simulations for flight and vehicle training VR solution-focused offerings will focus upon very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training Edge computing will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases  We see fully immersive virtual reality systems gaining substantial market momentum in consumer markets within the next few years. These VR systems will provide an unprecedented digital experience for humans, often including multiple senses as well as interaction with virtual objects and/or interaction between the real and virtual worlds. In terms of the consumer segment, we see current VR gaming evolving from current offerings such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PlayStation VR to more sophisticated entertainment that involves elements of casual gaming combined with real-world interests involving the economy and social status. In many respects, VR gaming is a greenfield opportunity, which will bring many new market entrants into the fray as application and content providers aggressively compete to establish a loyal user base. For example, Skydance Interactive, a division of Skydance Media, has recently unveiled The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners, initially available on Oculus Rift, Rift S, Quest, and HTC Vive. Successful companies will be those that develop communities of interest based on game-play and follower dynamics including innovation in interactive e-sports entertainment, in-game reward systems, and real-world to VR gamification integration. Long-term success will be dependent upon game delivery platform, system, and connectivity independence. This will occur coincident with a few key trends in platform/network transformation and service delivery such as the shift from console to cloud supported platforms and 5G communications supported by edge computing. Some very compelling enterprise VR applications are anticipated to emerge over the next three to five years. Many of these will be solution-focused upon achieving very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training. Enterprise applications will extend beyond internal use and B2B as businesses embrace the use of VR to reach consumer markets. Real estate is a prime example where VR may be used for education-sales such as training new home buyers while simultaneously marketing properties. We see the virtual reality market gaining ground once 5G is more firmly in place commercially, but not entirely due to wireless VR. Instead, we see a massive build-out of broadband as a whole (due to competition from the 5G market) as one of the fundamental drivers for VR adoption. This will be driven in part by substantially greater availability of FTTX and HFC as well as greater bandwidth overall at lower costs. 5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming. Previously encumbered by a combination of technology gaps and consumer readiness issues, the virtual reality market is poised for substantive global growth, providing abundant opportunities for service providers, content developers, and ecosystem component providers. While today many apps and services within the XR universe are very device-dependent and network constrained, convergence is on the horizon from a device perspective as well as substantial opportunities through untethering via 5G and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). MEC will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases. This will be particularly the case for VR portability, and to some extent, mobility to the extent that there is good 5G coverage. Substantially lower latency facilitated by the combination of 5G and MEC will lead to many new and enhanced applications. For example, VR-based telepresence will ultimately become the norm, starting with private enterprise solutions and the SMB markets through the likes of Zoom. Through Voice over 5G (Vo5G), there will also be support for Ultra High Definition (UHD) audio communications, streaming video, and ultra-clear voice communication for next-generation virtual reality applications and services. Vo5G will benefit VR for consumer and enterprise applications in many respects such as UHD becoming the norm in immersive experiences.

Time\\nSpeak directly to the analyst to clarify any post sales queries you may have.\\nThis report evaluates VR applications for the consumer and enterprise sectors for which we see gaming, education, and simulations training leading the way. The report assesses leading companies, strategies, products, and services. It provides analysis and forecasts for VR gaming, education, and simulations for 2021 through 2026.\\nSelect Report Findings:\\n* 5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming\\n* For training and instruction, we see everything from situational to more traditional expectations such as VR enhanced simulations for flight and vehicle training\\n* VR solution-focused offerings will focus upon very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training\\n* Edge computing will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases\\nWe see fully immersive virtual reality systems gaining substantial market momentum in consumer markets within the next few years. These VR systems will provide an unprecedented digital experience for humans, often including multiple senses as well as interaction with virtual objects and/or interaction between the real and virtual worlds.\\nIn terms of the consumer segment, we see current VR gaming evolving from current offerings such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PlayStation VR to more sophisticated entertainment that involves elements of casual gaming combined with real-world interests involving the economy and social status.\\nIn many respects, VR gaming is a greenfield opportunity, which will bring many new market entrants into the fray as application and content providers aggressively compete to establish a loyal user base. For example, Skydance Interactive, a division of Skydance Media, has recently unveiled The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, initially available on Oculus Rift, Rift S, Quest, and HTC Vive.\\nSuccessful companies will be those that develop communities of interest based on game-play and follower dynamics including innovation in interactive e-sports entertainment, in-game reward systems, and real-world to VR gamification integration. Long-term success will be dependent upon game delivery platform, system, and connectivity independence. This will occur coincident with a few key trends in platform/network transformation and service delivery such as the shift from console to cloud supported platforms and 5G communications supported by edge computing.\\nSome very compelling enterprise VR applications are anticipated to emerge over the next three to five years. Many of these will be solution-focused upon achieving very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training. Enterprise applications will extend beyond internal use and B2B as businesses embrace the use of VR to reach consumer markets. Real estate is a prime example where VR may be used for education-sales such as training new home buyers while simultaneously marketing properties.\\nWe see the virtual reality market gaining ground once 5G is more firmly in place commercially, but not entirely due to wireless VR. Instead, we see a massive build-out of broadband as a whole (due to competition from the 5G market) as one of the fundamental drivers for VR adoption. This will be driven in part by substantially greater availability of FTTX and HFC as well as greater bandwidth overall at lower costs.\\n5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming. Previously encumbered by a combination of technology gaps and consumer readiness issues, the virtual reality market is poised for substantive global growth, providing abundant opportunities for service providers, content developers, and ecosystem component providers.\\nWhile today many apps and services within the XR universe are very device-dependent and network constrained, convergence is on the horizon from a device perspective as well as substantial opportunities through untethering via 5G and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). MEC will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases. This will be particularly the case for VR portability, and to some extent, mobility to the extent that there is good 5G coverage.\\nSubstantially lower latency facilitated by the combination of 5G and MEC will lead to many new and enhanced applications. For example, VR-based telepresence will ultimately become the norm, starting with private enterprise solutions and the SMB markets through the likes of Zoom.\\nThrough Voice over 5G (Vo5G), there will also be support for Ultra High Definition (UHD) audio communications, streaming video, and ultra-clear voice communication for next-generation virtual reality applications and services. Vo5G will benefit VR for consumer and enterprise applications in many respects such as UHD becoming the norm in immersive experiences.\\nTarget Audience:\\n* Virtual reality companies\\n* Electronics manufacturers\\n* Network service providers\\n* Regulatory and policy groups\\n* Artificial intelligence providers\\n* Application and content providers\\nReport Benefits:\\n* Analysis and forecasts for VR in gaming, education, and simulations\\n* Understand the VR ecosystem including equipment, platforms, and services\\n* Identify the leading VR vendors, strategies, products, applications, and services\\n* Understand the VR market drivers including economics, adoption, and usage factors\\nWith the purchase of this report at the Multi-user License or greater level, you will have access to one hour with an expert analyst who will help you link key findings in the report to the business issues you\\'re addressing.

Growing media &amp; entertainment industry can be attributed with the steady market revenue growth. With the rapid growth of media and entertainment industry, digital human usage is projected to increase, which is expected to drive revenue growth of the digital human avatar market over the forecast period. For instance, on January 2023, ColorDigital, a German company, has partnered with its digital platform DMIx to introduce a collection of customizable virtual avatars. The primary objective behind this launch is to promote an end-to-end digital workflow for fashion brands. In collaboration with Verce, ColorDigital has developed two products: DMIx StudioAvatars and DMIx 3D-Studio. These products aim to facilitate sustainable production practices while also advocating for diversity and representation within fashion industry. By leveraging these virtual avatars, fashion brands can streamline their workflows and contribute to more sustainable and inclusive practices.\\nThe market revenue growth is expected to be restrained by a lack of understanding about the benefits of digital human avatars. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) gains traction in the business sector, many firms are looking for areas where technologies such as machine learning and deep learning can provide a competitive advantage. Customer service automation is one of the most promising use cases; in recent years, numerous businesses have created avatars that can assist organizations in relieving burden on their customer care workers and engaging with customers at scale. However, some people are skeptical of AI, and it can be difficult to get customers comfortable with the idea of connecting with new technology, especially if they feel obligated to speak with an impersonal application interface when they will be communicating with a human.   \\n \\n Some Key Highlights From the Report \\nOn 9 March 2023, Pantheon Lab, an AI startup based in Hong Kong, believes that AI-generated digital human avatars have the potential to be valuable in various industries, not only in Hong Kong but also beyond. This comes as there is growing public interest in advanced AI services, such as ChatGPT, that offer sophisticated conversational capabilities. Pantheon Lab aims to tap into this trend and offer AI-generated avatars to traditional industries, leveraging the potential of advanced AI technologies.\\nThe interactive digital human avatar segment is expected to account for largest revenue share in the global market over the forecast period owing to companies working on various Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities, product launches, and making innovations in existing product lines. For example, on July 5, 2023, NTT DATA announced imminent release of their ShotView technology, which would be backed by digital twin technology. ShotView incorporates millions of data points from the course in an interactive context to provide unmatched insights into the live golfing experience. NTT DATA will also present its latest AI-powered digital human platform, Lottie, at the event. Lottie will act as an educational and amusing guide for visitors, providing information about the event, participants, and sport itself, as well as guiding spectators with course navigation. NTT DATA\\'s digital human platform adds a human touch to the standard self-service interface by employing a lifelike digital avatar that duplicates human movement, sound, gestures, body language, facial emotions, and tone of voice.\\nThe entertainment segment is expected to account for largest revenue share in the global market over the forecast period. Digital human avatars provide entertainment makers unprecedented creative freedom and control. To meet their creative vision, filmmakers and animators can modify and fine-tune the look, behavior, and narrative arcs of these avatars. This adaptability enables the study of varied storytelling styles, character development, and imaginative worlds that would be difficult or costly to accomplish using traditional methods. Artists, animators, and performers can collaborate remotely using digital human avatars, allowing them to work from separate places. This worldwide accessibility dissolves geographical barriers and promotes cross-cultural partnerships, resulting in different and enhanced narrative experiences. In the entertainment industry, digital human avatars provide unique prospects for longer audience connection and commercialization. Fans can interact with their favorite characters through virtual experiences, virtual meet-and-greets, and virtual meet-and-greets.\\nThe digital human avatar market in North America accounted for largest revenue share in 2022. Factors such as increasing activities by leading market players, such as new releases and product expansions, among others, are driving revenue growth of the market in this region.

Introduction\\nRehabilitation is the process related to the recovery, maintenance or improvement of mental\\nand/or cognitive physical skills required to perform daily activities [1]. Generally, a\\nmultidisciplinary team such as physiotherapists, physicians, occupational therapists,\\npsychologists, speech therapists, among others, work together with the patient to achieve\\nthis goal. According to WHO [2], around 2.4 billion people currently live with a health\\nproblem that benefits from rehabilitation. Several treatment options for rehabilitation that\\nstimulate motor skills and neuropsychological capacity. Physiotherapy sessions,\\nDOI: 10.33969/AIS.2021.31009 October 15, 2021 130 Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Systems\\nJuliana Martins de Oliveira et al.\\noccupational therapies, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, music therapy, exposure therapies and\\nvirtual reality therapies [3] are examples used by specialists according to the type of disease,\\nage, patient interest and access to treatment. Virtual reality therapy, virtual reality\\nimmersion therapy, simulation therapy or virtual reality exposure therapy, is an intervention\\nmethod of using virtual reality technology for psychological or occupational therapy. The\\npossibility of simulating situations necessary for the treatment, controlling variables and\\nreducing the patient’s exposure to risks are popular factors for this tool. Many studies\\nindicate that therapy with the aid of virtual reality brings great benefits to the patient. This\\ntype of therapy is possible because virtual reality is an advanced interface for computer\\napplications, in which users can navigate and interact with a computer-generated\\nthree-dimensional environment through multisensory devices such as kinect, leap motion\\nand biomedical equipment [32][33][34].\\nVirtual reality environments combined with treatments for patients with cerebral palsy [7]\\n[8] [9] [10], stroke [11] [12], phobias [13] [14] [15] [16], Autism (Autism Spectrum\\nDisorder) [17] [18] [19] are examples of works that indicate this reality. To verify the\\neffectiveness of virtual reality (VR) in rehabilitation therapies, several techniques are\\napplied, such as comparisons of results of applications on volunteers. Clinical trial is a\\nprospective biomedical or behavioral research study of humans designed to answer specific\\nquestions about biomedical or behavioral interventions (vaccines, drugs, treatments,\\ndevices, or new ways of using known drugs, treatments, or devices). Clinical trials are used\\nto determine whether new biomedical or behavioral interventions are safe, effective, and\\nefficient [4][6]and can be used to perform this validation. The aim of this study was to\\nreview evidence supporting the effectiveness of virtual reality therapies in trial clinics for\\nmotor and cognitive rehabilitation helping us to answer the following questions:\\n1. What are the characteristics that identify the effectiveness of a clinical trial using VR?\\n2. What is the period of sessions used for clinical trials using VR?\\n3. What are the evaluation methods of the trial clinic?\\nIn this research, it is possible to view contributions of works related to the theme over\\nthe last 5 years, between 2016 and 2021. In total, 117 works were selected, which were\\nclassified according to the acceptance criteria defined in the methodology, based on the\\ninformation collected and classified through the P.I.C.O. (Patient, Intervention, Comparison\\nand Outcomes), which according to the Evidence-Based Practice (EBP), considers that these\\nelements are fundamental to the research question and the construction of the question for\\nthe bibliographic search for evidence. The P.I.C.O. can be used to build research questions of\\ndifferent natures, arising from the clinic, the management of human and material resources,\\nthe search for instruments for symptom assessment, among others [20].\\n2. Methodology\\nCarrying out this research is approached according to the following steps:\\n1. Develop research terms or keywords related to clinical trial and virtual reality;\\n2. Search for the most relevant study bases and adapt the keywords and expressions to\\nthe search engines referring to each search base;\\n3. Identify criteria for inclusion and exclusion of articles and classify them by P.I.C.O;\\nand\\n4. Establish conclusions based on findings related to the topic, as shown in the figure 1.\\n2.1. Develop search terms and keywords and objective\\nThe objective of identifying the keywords and expressions was to obtain a significant\\nnumber of results related to research on applications related to clinical trial using Virtual\\nReality as a complementary tool to the motor rehabilitation of patients with neurological\\ndisorders, a topic addressed in our study.The query was defined as: “clinical trial” associated\\nDOI: 10.33969/AIS.2021.31009 131 Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Systems\\nJuliana Martins de Oliveira et al.\\nFigure 1.

Defining a clinical question in terms of the patient’s specific problem helps\\nthe researcher to find clinically relevant evidence in the literature. The P.I.C.O. template is a\\nformat to help define the survey question [30] [31].\\n2.4. Establish conclusions based on findings related to the topic.\\nFindings were divided according to the type of disease or related problem. As the objective\\nof this study is not limited to the disease, but to the type of method applied, to identify\\nthe best results obtained, articles are classified and evaluated by groups according to the\\nsimilarity of the disease. Finally, a general conclusion obtained analyzing the results of each\\ngroup will be considered.\\n2.5. Analysis of Results\\nBased on the objectives of this work in the search for an understanding of clinical trial\\napplications using virtual reality in rehabilitation therapies, the following keywords were\\ndefined: \"Clinical trial\" and \"Virtual reality\", \"Clinical Trial\" and \"Virtual environment\", \"\\nClinical essay \"and \"artificial environment\" found in the title, abstract and or keyword.

That includes 72% of the desktop market and 92% of the mobile search engine market.\\n \\nGoogle’s nearest competitor, Bing, only holds 2.9% of market share, while Yahoo accounts for 1.1%. The distribution has remained relatively stable over the past few years with Google consistently claiming competitive victory thanks to detailed search results, in-depth analytics, and evolving service offerings.\\nConsider the rapid uptake of \"Google\" as a verb meaning, \"to search\" — \"I’ll just Google it,\" \"can’t you Google that?\" \"isn’t it on Google?\" It’s not an exaggeration to say that when it comes to searching for information online, Google is — by far — the digital frontrunner.\\nHow many Google searches per day?\\nGoogle doesn’t share its search volume data. However, it’s estimated Google processes approximately 99,000 search queries every second, translating to 8.5 billion searches per day and approximately 2 trillion global searches per year. The average person conducts between three and four searches each day.\\n \\nGoogle also makes efforts to personalize search results, in turn, increasing the chances that users will opt for Google the next time they have a question. For users that aren’t logged into a Gmail or another Google account, the company uses anonymously stored browser cookies to get a sense of search histories and preferences.\\nFor users signed into their Google account, Chrome’s browser history provides the data necessary for Google to construct a profile based on age, language preference, gender and search preferences, which informs the type of search results returned. Location offers an easy example of this approach — if users have location services turned on, Google search results will be filtered by geographic location to increase overall relevance.\\nNow, let’s look at a few of this year\\'s top Google Search statistics and take a deeper dive into the trending searches that guide your marketing strategy.\\n \\nTop Google Search Statistics in 2023\\nLet’s look at how Google influences search with these latest statistics.\\n65% of SEOs say Google’s 2023 algorithm updates have positively impacted web traffic and SERP rankings.

While most use cases for VR and AR are still related to gaming, entertainment, and social media, the variety of applications is expanding as more consumers and businesses test out immersive experiences.    How many people in the US will use VR and AR this year?   We expect 58.9 million people will use VR and 93.3 million will use AR at least once per month in 2021. These numbers represent 17.7% and 28.1% of the US population, respectively.   How has the global pandemic affected the market for VR and AR?   Because the pandemic has forced many people to work, socialize, study, and shop at home, they’re using XR experiences to replace in-person ones. While supply chain and distribution issues temporarily disrupted shipments of VR hardware in H2 2020, demand for all types of XR content will translate to more users over the forecast period.   How are this year’s forecasts different from last year’s?   This year, we revised our previous estimates upward to reflect faster-than-expected growth in both VR and AR users. Pandemic-induced conditions have catalyzed interest in both technologies, and developers are stepping up to meet increased demand.   How will the introduction of 5G wireless connectivity and other advanced technologies affect VR and AR usage?   The convergence of 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and edge cloud processing will soon make it easier to deliver more seamless, enjoyable, and cost-effective XR experiences across a variety of connected devices.   WHAT’S IN THIS REPORT? This report includes our 2019–2023 forecasts for VR and AR users in the US, along with an analysis of the forces shaping the growth of these technologies. ||||I|||| Contact Sales:1-800-405-0844\\nDoes my company subscribe?\\nNewsletter sign-up\\nLog in\\nBecome a Client\\nBecome a ClientGet a DemoPricing\\nIndustriesProductsInsightsEventsPricingAbout\\nOpen Menu\\nIndustries\\nAdvertising & Marketing\\nSocial MediaContent MarketingEmail MarketingVideoBrowse All →\\nEcommerce & Retail\\nEcommerce SalesMcommerceRetail SalesSocial CommerceBrowse All →\\nFinancial Services\\nBankingPaymentsFintechWealth ManagementBrowse All →\\nHealth\\nValue-Based CareDigital TherapeuticsTelehealthOnline PharmacyBrowse All →\\nTechnology\\nConnected Devices5GArtificial Intelligence (AI)Browse All →\\nMore Industries\\nReal EstateCustomer ExperienceB2BTravelSmall Business (SMB)Browse All →\\nGeographies\\nAsia-PacificCentral & Eastern EuropeLatin AmericaMiddle East & AfricaNorth AmericaWestern Europe\\nAll Topics\\nProducts\\nReports\\nIn-depth analysis, benchmarks and shorter spotlights on digital trends.\\nForecasts\\nInteractive projections with 10k+ metrics on market trends, & consumer behavior.\\nCharts\\nProprietary data and over 3,000 third-party sources about the most important topics.\\nIndustry KPIs\\nIndustry benchmarks for the most important KPIs in digital marketing, advertising, retail and ecommerce.\\nBriefings\\nClient-only email newsletters with analysis and takeaways from the daily news.\\nInsightsEventsPricingAbout\\nOur StoryMethodologyOur PeopleContact Us\\nLog in Newsletter sign-up1-800-405-0844\\nBecome a Client\\nClose Menu\\nUS Virtual and Augmented Reality Users 2021\\nXR Use Expands Beyond Fun and Games\\nReport by Victoria Petrock | Apr 15, 2021\\nReportDeckCharts\\nTable of Contents\\nDownload\\nReport\\nDeck\\nShare\\nTable of Contents\\nExecutive Summary\\nPandemic Galvanizes XR Landscape\\nVirtual Reality: A Bumpy Road to Growth\\nAugmented Reality: Greater Utility Drives More Use\\nKey Takeaways\\nRead Next\\nSources\\nMedia Gallery\\nAbout This Report\\nThis report provides our latest forecasts for VR and AR users in the US and examines some market dynamics affecting the maturation of immersive technologies.\\nTopics\\nAugmented & Virtual Reality\\nUnited States\\nTable of Contents\\nExecutive Summary\\nPandemic Galvanizes XR Landscape\\nVirtual Reality: A Bumpy Road to Growth\\nAugmented Reality: Greater Utility Drives More Use\\nKey Takeaways\\nRead Next\\nSources\\nMedia Gallery\\nExecutive Summary\\nExtended reality (XR) technologies, including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) are still in the early phases of adoption, but they are evolving quickly.

Our clients received access to our latest VR games market estimates and forecasts. \\nBack in the early 2010s, many people expected virtual reality to quickly flourish into a huge gaming segment.\\nWhile the market ultimately did not take off like many expected, moves in big tech, the metaverse trend, and changes in behavior among younger consumers are giving VR—and especially VR relating to gaming—a second wind.\\nWhile VR likely won’t grow into a massive segment alongside traditional gaming platforms anytime soon, its future is promising. The active VR install base is growing faster than ever before—from 27.7 million this year to 46.0 million by the end of 2024.\\nMeanwhile, yearly VRgame revenues are also on the rise, from $1.8 billion this year to $3.2 billion by 2024.\\nIn this article, we will explore the developments and data around VR’s growth. If you already want all the details, download this free report we recently worked on.\\nVR’s Install Base Will Grow Over Fivefold from 2019 to 2024 \\nAs you can see below, VR’s install base is rapidly climbing. It will grow from 8 million active headsets in 2019—passing 10 million in 2020 and 20 million in 2021—to hit 46.0 million in 2024:\\n   \\n Please note: Newzoo’s VR market-sizing scope covers consumer VR headsets capable of Six Degrees of Freedom (DoF) positional tracking and VR games revenues generated through these headsets. Learn more about our VR methodology .\\nFrom 2019 until now, there have been many reasons for VR’s active hardware growth:\\n Meta’s Quest headset family: Thanks to its accessibility, Meta’s first 6DoF standalone headset—the Quest—reopened the VR floodgates in 2019. The headset is standalone (needing no extra hardware) and wireless. This easy setup, boosted by its successor the Quest 2’s affordable price (starting at $299 at launch/$399 from August 2022), helped lower VR’s barrier to entry. \\n Pandemic-related lockdown measures: When gamers were confined to their home, the wider games market saw a massive boost as consumers looked to games for socializing and escapism. Thanks to its immersion, many consumers turned to virtual reality (games) to fulfill these needs—as well as a means to keep fit. The Meta Quest 2 gave consumers a quick path to VR during these times.  \\n VR gaming’s first AAA killer app: \\nHalf-Life: Alyx reignited excitement for VR among core gamers and game developers. Valve developed the game specifically for its propriety premium VR headset, the Valve Index (launched in 2019). Making Alyx exclusive to VR was a clever way for Valve to draw fans to the VR market (and its Index headset).\\nLooking for case studies on VR’s killer apps and a technical overview of the market’s biggest headsets?

Until very recently, Pico remained a B2C company for VR hardware only in China (and B2B in the West).\\nFollowing a soft launch of an older headset in Western Europe, Pico officially launched its new Pico 4 standalone headset in the region in October. The base model costs €429 at launch, €20 lower than Meta’s Quest 2, which launched in 2020 and recently had a price hike.\\nOn paper, the Pico 4 has better specs than the Quest—as well as new quality-of-life improvements like a lighter design and color passthrough features (allowing VR apps to integrate mixed-reality experiences).\\nWe will continue to see other tech giants entering the market to claim a slice of Meta’s VR pie. Thanks to these USPs, standalone headsets will further democratize VR gaming for general consumers, increasing VR’s user base.\\nSony is launching its PlayStation VR2 in early 2023, which will attract millions of new-gen console gamers to the VR market. Yet, it is worth noting that PS VR2’s total addressable market is tied to the install base of PS5, which is still in short supply. Nevertheless, PS VR 2 will boast innovative sensory tech, higher-fidelity visuals, and enhanced tracking—including haptics and adaptive trigger features—and eye-tracking.\\nLooking for consumer research about the demographics of current VR headset owners (and why they use VR)? Download this report for free. \\nVR Game Revenues Are Also on the Rise\\nNaturally, more active (affordable) headsets mean more active players looking to spend, resulting in more developers creating engaging content. This content will attract even more players and them to spend more on VR games.\\nTo that end, yearly VR game revenues will increase more than sixfold in five years, from $0.5 billion in 2019 to $3.2 billion in 2024 (a CAGR of +44.0%).\\nIn the coming years, two major factors will drive VR revenues: the growth of its install base and an increase in average spend per user (following a temporary decline in 2022).\\nNext year, revenues will surpass the two-billion-dollar mark for the first time:\\n   \\nWith the Quest 3 in development and PS VR2 on the way, Meta and Sony will further boost their VR content strategies via first- and third-party studios (and their already popular IP). A couple of high-profile examples include:\\n   A Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas port in development for the Quest headsets, following the well-received Resident Evil 4 port in 2021;\\n   Horizon Call of the Mountain for the PS VR2, and we expect to see PlayStation leveraging more first-party IP like Horizon as time goes on.\\nThese companies increasing investment into VR content will attract more players, leading to more entries, investments in the space, and bigger-budget game announcements (some based on renowned IP) toward 2024.\\n Meta in particular has been acquiring talented VR-first studios lately, including Camouflaj (developer of Iron Man VR) and Armature Studio (developer of Resident Evil 4‘s VR port). Pico is also rapidly investing in its VR content library, supporting VR developers in porting content to its devices. Pico will also have its first major exclusive game, Just Dance VR, through a partnership with Ubisoft.\\nBut what kinds of VR games do players enjoy? Download the free report for a deep dive into engagement data for VR’s most popular genres, themes, and game mechanics.\\nOngoing Innovations in VR Hardware, Software, and Beyond Will Lead to Even More Opportunities\\nWhat distinguishes VR from flatscreen gaming is a heightened sense of immersion and meaningful interaction with virtual worlds both via input and feedback. Ongoing improvements in headsets, controllers, and peripherals will pave the way for more immersive and higher-fidelity VR experiences.\\nCurious about the business ecosystem for VR games? Find an ecosystem diagram here.\\nVR hardware is quickly advancing, including eye tracking and foveated rendering in the PS VR2—as well as the color passthrough feature in Meta’s high-end Quest Pro.\\nThe latter headset is expensive—too costly for most consumers—and meant for ‘’professional’’ VR users.\\nResearch and development in user immersion tech—like haptic gloves and suits, and treadmills (to simulate walking)—is making huge progress.\\nCurrently, most of these peripherals are expensive and B2B focused (some have limited B2C features). While it will take years for compelling haptic and full-body tracking to become affordable, we expect to see such tech in consumers’ homes eventually. \\nTo conclude, the VR install base is growing faster than ever before, VR is becoming a more sustainable platform for developers, and high-quality content seems to be imminent.\\n VR has found its killer use case for consumers: gaming. The games industry has always embraced innovation and cutting-edge technology, catalyzing these technologies to spread into other sectors. VR is following that same trajectory.\\nVR technology can prove essential for many industries, from manufacturing and retail to healthcare and education. We will see further developments in VR hardware, software, and use cases (even beyond gaming) in the coming years, helping push this exciting market forward.\\nIf you want to jump even deeper into our VR data and insights, download this free report.

Reach out to us here; we’re happy to help! \\nPicture this: What if search engines could understand user intent, personalize search results, and even predict what users are looking for? How would that change the way we approach SEO and content creation? Well, prepare yourselves because artificial intelligence is making its way into the world of search.  \\nThis means that the algorithm will change, and the strategies us marketers once used to rank on will rank on a different system. So what does that mean for marketers?\\nWe explore the game-changing implications of AI in SERPs through the perspective of our blog team experts to reveal the steps bloggers, just like you, are taking to adapt and succeed in this new paradigm. But before we dive in, let\\'s clarify what AI in search engines means.\\n       \\nHow do AI-powered search engines work?\\nAI-powered search engines use natural language processing and machine-learning techniques to deliver personalized, relevant, and even human-like responses.\\nThis type of search allows users to generate more unique or concise responses than traditional search that retrieves results based on relevant keywords, backlinks, and authority. For example, before suggestions of AI in search engines, many publishers would try to keyword stuff content to better rank, but in turn, would put out irrelevant results that aren\\'t always useful.\\nSo now, with the introduction of Bard AI, Bing Chat, and other large search engines that\\'re changing how we scour the web, bloggers must learn to adapt to the new landscape.\\n How Bloggers are Preparing for AI in Search \\nI posed the question, \"How are you preparing for AI in search?\" to my colleagues in the HubSpot Blog Team, and received very different responses from each, offering a new perspective on the way we\\'ll work with AI and search engines.\\n 1. They\\'re sharing  expert insights that AI can\\'t replicate. \\nWe asked the Head of Content Growth, Pamela Bump, about how her team is preparing for a change in search, and her game plan offers excellent insight.\\n \"Two areas my team is focusing on right now are expert insights and original research. At the moment, we believe Google and other search engines will begin prioritizing blog content that isn\\'t easily generated by AI on its own. For example, AI can\\'t easily schedule and run surveys or interviews of real people, or build relationships with expert sources on a personal or professional level. However, this is often the exact type of content our personas already crave.\" \\nWhile AI is a wonderful tool to help bloggers create content, it shouldn‘t be the driving force behind it. Marketing teams exist to share creative and insightful ideas to better serve the professionals that seek them. Artificial intelligence might generate results from older ideas that don’t understand your current buyer persona as much as you do.\\n 2. They\\'re offering authentic and credible data. \\nBump continues to say, \" And, ultimately, while decision-makers in our audience might find our data in a GPT summary at some point in the future, they\\'ll likely want to visit our actual website to determine if the data or quotes AI has given them are actually factual and credible, enabling us to still gain traffic and authority.\" \\nMarketers and bloggers alike know the importance of sharing fresh and accurate information. Our team will continue to invest in authentic research that reflects reality, never publishing false statistics to push a narrative, and other companies should do the same to serve the audience and the SERP better.\\n 3. They\\'re incorporating AI into workflows and day-to-day tasks. \\nAssociate Marketing Manager, Madhu Murali, emphasized the importance of personally being familiar with artificial intelligence.\\n \"I\\'m preparing for AI by using it as much as possible in my daily workflow. For now, this means using Content Assistant by HubSpot for ideation, drafts, and SEO-optimized outlines, and experimenting with Midjourney for image creation. AI will be a growing part of our lives, so the more I can stay ahead of the curve, the better!\" \\nWe ran a 2023 Glimpse survey of 400+ professionals, and according to the respondents, about 58% of them claimed they were incorporating AI tools into their workflow. Both professionals in our team and out see the importance of learning to use new technology as it arises, and learning how to use it to improve your day-to-day work is invaluable in itself.\\nOne way that you can start to learn how to use artificial intelligence in your blog is through platform features like HubSpot\\'s content assistant or campaign assistant. Create blog outlines in a pinch, generate copy that fits your brand voice, and explore how AI can improve your workflow with these platform features.\\n   \\n Get started with HubSpot\\'s AI tools \\n 4. They\\'re building on the foundations  of SEO. \\nSenior Marketing Manager Basha Coleman shares a great reminder on how bloggers should continue building on the fundamentals.\\n \"I\\'m paying attention to the basics of content SEO that are within my control. Interlinking, images, storytelling, and offering my perspective on topics are elements that will always be essential to a content strategy and won\\'t disappear as generative AI search emerges. I can always build on top of that foundation to optimize for AI in search, but while things are still in flux, I\\'m shoring up the fundamentals of my content.\" \\nEveryone will have something to learn from AI in search, but that doesn\\'t mean we have to forget everything we already know about making good content. Until AI in search becomes more commonplace, refine your pre-existing skills and strategy to better your chances of ranking and meeting your reader\\'s needs.\\n 5. They\\'re maintaining a flexible strategy and mindset . \\nSEO Content Writer Madison Vettorino shares that being ready for change is the best mindset for the introduction of AI in search.\\n \" I think more than ever it‘s important to remember that as writers we’ve had to pivot before due to innovations in the SERPs landscape, and we‘re being asked to do it again. So I think keeping a degree of flexibility in your content strategy is important. The reality is we don’t know how AI in search will impact content yet. But as for right now, I‘m preparing by learning as much as I can about how major search engines are planning on integrating AI. And, of course, I’m maintaining that flexible mindset. We can and will pivot and create content that stands out and fulfills our ultimate mission to inform readers, even if that looks a little different in this new search landscape.\" \\nA stagnant marketing strategy can only serve a blog team for so long. It\\'s up to you to prepare for the unknown and to change your perspective and workflow to serve an ever-changing algorithm better.\\n 6. They\\'re learning from their peers. \\nVettorino continues on to say that when she\\'s looking for clarity or context on AI, she can rely on her team to get her up to speed.\\n \"I\\'ve also been fortunate enough to speak with members of our SEO team who have been kind enough to share their insights on what AI may mean for the future of search. If you\\'re fortunate enough to have the opportunity to talk about this, you\\'ll hear a lot of interest, excitement, and enthusiasm about what this means for the SERPs. So talk to folks who specialize in SEO, sit down and schedule a 15-minute coffee chat with them and soak up all their knowledge about how things may be changing.\" \\nThere‘s no shame in reaching out to your coworkers for their knowledge on the subject, and how it’ll affect your strategy as you begin to work with it.\\nAnd if you\\'re looking to learn more about changes in search, check out AI podcasts and other resources to start educating yourself on what these changes may look like in practice so you\\'re as prepared as you can be.\\n Learn to Work with AI in Search \\nAs the influence of artificial intelligence grows and becomes more integrated into SERPs, bloggers must adapt and prepare for these changes. By staying up-to-date with the latest AI advancements, understanding the evolving dynamics of user intent, and creating valuable and engaging content, bloggers can position themselves to thrive in this new era of search. \\nOnce the domain of gamers and young social media users, AR and VR are entering the mainstream. This year, more than a quarter of the US population will use AR and nearly a fifth will use VR. As device-makers improve VR headsets and AR spreads to new use cases, the number of AR and VR users will continue to grow over the next four years, with AR outpacing VR.    AR user numbers will exceed 100 million in 2024.  We’ve lowered our estimate for current users to 89.4 million in 2022 because of access to better data—but we remain bullish on future growth. \\nWe expect the number of AR users in the US to increase by more than 20 million people between 2022 and 2025.\\nBy the end of this year, 29.7% of US internet users will use AR.

It\\'s quickly become one of the buzziest words of 2023, akin to the popularity of the phrase \"new normal\" in 2022.  \\nAnd for good reason. AI is poised to completely revolutionize the ways in which we work, interact, and even play.\\nI\\'ve been on the HubSpot Blog team for over five years, and in that time, I\\'ve seen plenty of changes. Back in 2017, for instance, we completely upended our blog infrastructure with the introduction of the pillar-cluster model.\\nAnd then, in 2018, we ditched our weekly \"throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks\" brainstorming process in favor of something a little more, well, efficient: the Search Insights Reports, which we still use today.\\nBut none of these changes seem to compare to what\\'s coming with AI. Here, I\\'ll explain how HubSpot\\'s Blog team plans to leverage AI without sacrificing the \"human element\" that makes our content successful in the first place.\\n(P.S. We\\'re still figuring this out just like you are, so think of this as a working doc that I\\'ll update periodically as we shift our AI strategies in the future.)\\n       \\n 1. The HubSpot Blog Team Will Use Generative AI to Learn About Topics Faster — But We Won\\'t Use AI Alone to Create Content. \\nOne of the strongest benefits of generative AI is its ability to scan the web and provide concise, helpful responses based on vast sources of information.\\nIn other words: As a writer, I don\\'t turn to Google first anymore for information. Instead, I turn to AI.\\nFor instance, the other day I needed to write a post about — ironically — the differences between ChatGPT, Google\\'s Bard, and Bing\\'s new AI-powered search engine.\\nSo I asked ChatGPT: \"Can you tell me the differences between ChatGPT, Google\\'s Bard, and Bing\\'s AI-powered search engine? Please put the pros and cons in a table format.\"\\nHere\\'s what I got back:\\n \\nNotice I didn\\'t ask ChatGPT to write the post for me.\\nOn our team, we are not using AI to write full posts. Instead, our criteria is as follows:\\nWe will never use generative AI to write a full blog post, start-to-finish, without any editing for voice, accuracy, or adding a unique, human perspective.\\nWe will typically use AI more for cut-and-dry, straightforward, tactical posts. Topics like \"The 11 Best Ways to Send Large Files\" perform particularly well using AI; but more complex, trendy, or thought leadership-type content do not.\\nWe will use AI to brainstorm topics or research ideas, but we will always do our own follow-up research to ensure the information is accurate, and to limit potential biases.\\nAs Kaitlin Milliken, HubSpot Blog\\'s Program Manager &amp; Content Editor, shares: \"AI is a big part of my research process. Certain product descriptions are vague or don\\'t offer enough information about what makes the software stand out. In these cases, I\\'ll ask AI what makes a certain product unique. It will give me a list of features that can then help inform my writing/editing.\"\\nSimply put, human beings read HubSpot blog posts to learn how other human beings are selling, marketing, or servicing their customers. We want to respect that trust by continuing to create content that is meant to educate, engage, and delight.\\nWhen we can use AI to speed up the time it takes us to research topics or create outlines, that\\'s great — that means more time to spend on voice, tone, and perspective.\\nBut we will never use AI to replace what humans have always done best: Storytelling.\\n \\n 2. The HubSpot Blog Team Will Leverage Generative AI to Create Outlines … But Not Full Posts. \\nAs previously mentioned, our Blog team will not be using generative AI to create full blog posts.\\nThat doesn\\'t mean we won\\'t leverage the power of AI to greatly cut down the time we spend writing. It simply means we\\'ll treat AI outputs similar to how we might treat outlines or freelance drafts.\\nNamely: AI outputs can act as the first draft of an article, but not the final copy.\\nConsider, for instance, a post that provides 34 definitions of SQL keywords, operators, and statements, which HubSpot Blog Manager, Marketing Clint Fontanella recently wrote for the Website Blog. A post of that length would typically require weeks of research and writing.\\nWith AI, Fontanella told me it took roughly 40% of the time to create it.\\nAs he puts it, \"AI is going to remove the manual process of content creation so writers can become marketers again and focus more on the creative process. AI copywriting will eliminate tedious tasks like writing definitions and creating outlines, so writers can spend more time on optimizing the post (likely using AI tools) with things like custom multimedia, interactive modules, high-intent internal linking, and more.\"\\nParticularly for more cut-and-dry topics like lengthy listicles, it\\'s imperative our writers lean into AI to save their time for more complex pieces, or to up-level the multimedia elements included in their posts.\\nAdditionally, many of our writers use AI to write sections of blog posts.\\nFor instance, Tristen Taylor, HubSpot Blog team\\'s Associate Marketing Manager, told me, \"Before using AI, I often found myself rewriting introductions and conclusion paragraphs in blog posts. Now that I have access to these tools, my time needed for completing blog posts or articles has been cut down tremendously because it can capture the tone, intent, and targeted keywords I need through refined AI prompts.\"\\nShe adds, \"It also allows me to refocus my work more on the content or information of value that readers are looking for, instead of ruminating over small details at the beginning or end.\"\\n 3. The HubSpot Blog Team Will Take Advantage of Generative AI as Our New, Trusty Brainstorming Sidekick.  \\nI\\'ve been reading a lot about how live shopping is going to become the new \"norm\" in retail, and I knew there could be an interesting angle to write. But I couldn\\'t fully flesh one out.\\nSo I turned to ChatSpot, HubSpot\\'s new AI-powered chatbot, and asked, \"Please provide me with seven blog post ideas based on the concept of live shopping becoming the status quo for the retail industry.\"\\nHere\\'s its response:\\n \\nNot too shabby, huh? From there, I can workshop by myself or with a colleague to formulate the final topic. But in this case, ChatSpot didn\\'t just save me time — it also introduced a new perspective and more creative, interesting ideas that I hadn\\'t previously considered.\\nIn other words, one of the biggest benefits of generative AI is its ability to act as your new, always-available, infinitely-creative colleague.\\nAnd this makes all of HubSpot Blog team\\'s in-person brainstorming sessions much more effective and compelling.\\n 4. The HubSpot Blog Team Will Experiment with AI-Generated Videos for Our Blog Posts. \\nVideo is more important than ever. In fact, our 2023 State of Marketing report found that video is the most popular and effective media format for the fourth year in a row.\\nBut creating videos takes time and resources. And there are some topics, like CSS Grid Layouts, that were previously not worth the effort it took in terms of potential video MSV.\\nThis left some major gaps in our content strategy. While CSS Grid Layouts might not be the snazziest YouTube video (I get it … it\\'s probably not going to go viral), it is a topic that is complex and potentially confusing — making it an ideal candidate for a quick, easy how-to video for our readers who are interested in learning more about CSS layouts.\\nEnter: Veed.io, a video editing software with AI tools built-in, such as their AI image generator and AI text reader. \\nThe Website Blog leveraged Veed to create their own CSS grid video with an AI-generated voice-over in less than an hour.\\nPlus, as our team leans into AI for brainstorming, outlining, and researching, we will be able to find more time to experiment with projects like this one.\\nFor our team, this is just the beginning. We will continue to test and iterate on our AI-generated video strategy to expand videos across Blogs for greater impact in the months to come.\\n 5. The HubSpot Blog Team Will Use Generative AI for Meta descriptions, Social Summaries, and Email Descriptions. \\nFor some reason, I often hit the greatest writer\\'s block after I\\'ve finished a post and I\\'m asked by a social media manager or email manager to summarize it.\\nIn some ways, perhaps it\\'s most difficult because I know the topic too well. Everything in my post seems important. How can I possibly pick what is most relevant to include?\\nQuickly figuring out the right messaging to promote your content is one of the most powerful opportunities with AI. In fact, I worked with ChatSpot to come up with the meta description for this post:\\n \\n Jamie Juviler, Managing Editor of the Website Blog, also leverages AI for meta descriptions. He suggests feeding your introduction paragraph into an AI chatbot, and then asking it to produce a 100-150 character meta description.\\nFinding small ways to elevate your promotional copy by leveraging AI is key to harnessing its full potential.\\n HubSpot\\'s Blog Team Will Continue to Write Human-to-Human, First  \\nOne more thing — we want to lead with transparency for our audiences, so we do promise this: On any post we write that has been AI-supported (or AI-generated, even if it has been human-edited), we will be sure to leave a disclaimer that lets you know that we leveraged AI to complete the post.\\n \\nIt\\'s also important to note that our team is learning as we go. Similar to the advent of any new, exciting technology, AI comes with plenty of benefits … and plenty of drawbacks.\\nLearning how to mold AI into the type of tool that fits our existing priorities and quality metrics will be key to retaining the audiences we\\'ve worked so hard to build. At its core, we know AI can\\'t replace the humanity behind marketing. So we won\\'t try to. \\nThe world of artificial intelligence and machine learning is expanding, and marketers should pay attention. AI is being implemented in nearly every industry to improve business processes, and the data surrounding this tech are staggering.  \\n     \\nTo help you better grasp AI\\'s most recent advancements, we\\'ve compiled a list of interesting AI statistics to consider before you use it for your own company strategy.

The VR supermarket, the recommendation system, and the database. The VR supermarket provides a 360-degree virtual environment for users to move and interact in the virtual environment through VR devices. The recommendation system will make intelligent recommendations to the target users based on the data in the database. The intelligent recommendation system is developed based on item similarity (ICF), which solves the cold start problem of ICF. This allows VR supermarkets to present real-time recommendations in any situation. It not only makes up for the lack of user perception of item attributes in traditional online shopping systems but also VR Supermarket improves the shopping efficiency of users through the intelligent recommendation system. The application can be extended to enterprise-level systems, which adds new possibilities for users to do VR shopping at home.\\nI.

According to IDC 2021, the augmented global reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) headset market grew 92. 1% year over year in 2021. Shipments of AR/VR headsets are forecast to grow 46.9% year-over-year in 2022, reaching double-digit growth by 2026. VR has three main features: 360-degree visual freedom, interactivity, and real-time [1]. 360-degree visual freedom is the key feature of VR [2], which means that users can move their view freely in 360 degrees and experience the immersive feeling. The second is characterized by real-time, which means that objects in the virtual environment are running in real-time to immerse the user. The third feature, interactivity, refers to the extent to which the user can manipulate objects in the simulated environment and the natural degree of feedback received from the environment, i.e., if the user touches an object in the virtual space and moves it, the object\\'s position and state should also change. So far, VR technology has been used in several fields, such as VR conferencing [3], advertising [4], tourism [5] and so on. With the development of technology, VR devices are not as expensive as they used to be, such as Google\\'s Cardboard, which allows users to interact with objects in the virtual environment through gaze control. In September 2020, Facebook released the Oculus Quest2, which supports wireless streaming mode, allowing users to walk around virtual scenes more freely. More importantly, young people nowadays maintain a strong interest in VR technology. This means that the time is ripe for research and development of immersive VR.\\nVirtual shopping is the most promising area for VR business model [6][7][8][9]; eBay (virtual reality department store), Alibaba (Buy +), IKEA (virtual reality kitchen showroom) and other business giants are trying to embed business services into virtual reality in an attempt to revolutionize the business shopping model again. VR shopping creates an opportunity for users to enter any shopping environment, anytime, anywhere, addressing space and time constraints [10] and improving the overall efficiency of users\\' shopping. However, this virtual shopping software cannot make personalized recommendations to users. So to overcome this difficulty, a recommendation system is a good choice. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most widely known technique for this system [11,12]. Collaborative filtering algorithms are divided into User Collaborative Filtering (UCF) and Item Collaborative Filtering (ICF). Both algorithms have a recommendation system model based on the user-item rating matrix. However, the difference is that ICF analyzes the similarity between items and then takes the items with higher similarity to the target user\\'s rating \\nTABLE 1 ANALYSIS PERIOD OF THE STUDYTABLE 2

This survey focuses on the intelligence and spatio-temporal characteristics of four fundamental system components in ubiquitous semantic Metaverse, i.e., artificial intelligence (AI), spatio-temporal data representation (STDR), semantic Internet of Things (SIoT), and semantic-enhanced digital twin (SDT). We thoroughly survey the representative techniques of the four fundamental system components that enable intelligent, personalized, and context-aware interactions with typical use cases of the ubiquitous semantic Metaverse, such as remote education, work and collaboration, entertainment and socialization, healthcare, and e-commerce marketing. Furthermore, we outline the opportunities for constructing the future ubiquitous semantic Metaverse, including scalability and interoperability, privacy and security, performance measurement and standardization, as well as ethical considerations and responsible AI. Addressing those challenges is important for creating a robust, secure, and ethically sound system environment that offers engaging immersive experiences for the users and AR/VR applications.\\n \\nSubmission history  From: Kai Li [view email]  [v1]\\nThu, 13 Jul 2023 11:14:46 UTC (2,759 KB)\\n [v2] \\nSat, 5 Aug 2023 15:34:42 UTC (4,983 KB)\\n  ||||I|||| Skip to main content\\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, member institutions , and all contributors.

At present, artificial intelligence technology runs through the new retail supply chain, creating the \"unmanned new retail\" mode, and realizing cost reduction, efficiency improvement, deepening upgrade and better consumption experience. However, the market sales structure of intelligent new retail formats is mixed with worries, and the development of regional new retail formats is not balanced. In view of this, this paper, based on the artificial intelligence perspective, discusses the wheel of \"new retail\" driven by artificial intelligence, further analyzes the development pattern of the new retail format structure, and proposes the road to optimize the structure of intelligent new retail format.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThroughout the supply chain, reducing costs, improving efficiency and deepening the upgrade\\nFrom traditional retail to e-commerce retail and new retail, many new technologies are applied. The essence of these technologies cannot be separated from artificial intelligence to help realize the goal of intelligent new retail. [1]Artificial intelligence technology can build a logistics network technology platform, intelligently identify and evaluate customer traffic, and make adjustment feedback and operation analysis from intelligent data, so as to improve operation efficiency to a certain extent.Artificial intelligence is deeply involved in the new retail format. Intelligent retailers conduct supply chain and store data management and integration through RFID technology, so as to realize the effective management of commodity display and accurate grasp of consumer interest in intelligent retail stores, and achieve the goal of reducing cost and improving efficiency.Artificial intelligence technology has given birth to modern intelligent stores, intelligent logistics and warehousing, intelligent marketing and experience, intelligent customer service and intelligent virtual experience and other business scenarios, and to a certain extent, improved the work efficiency of new retail.\\nCreates \"unmanned new retail\" model to shape better consumer experience\\nArtificial intelligence is the driving force of modern new retail technology, creating the \"unmanned new retail\" mode, focusing on the evolution of \"consumers, scenes and commodities\", and reconstructing, integrating and optimizing the payment method and format structure of intelligent new retail. [2]Amazon\\'s \"no-man\\'s-land\" and check-out free shopping experience USES computer vision, sensors and deep learning.Amazon, Alibaba and JINGdong purchased or invested heavily in offline smart retail stores in 2017. While expanding new retail marketing channels, they also acquired intelligent and efficient operation big data to build an ARTIFICIAL intelligence retail model and improve the subsequent processes such as intelligent retail, layout, replenishing-stock and production scheduling.Jingdong smart retail consumers, through large data positioning is given priority to with younger, social and diversified consumption scenarios, in just brush face and become members of the store, the background by 3 d camera to bind the body characteristic and the account information for intelligent video analysis, automatic recording consumer product experience, facilitate accurate secondary commodity marketing, strengthen the consumer shopping experience. [3]\\n2.THE DEVELOPMENT PATTERN OF FORMAT STRUCTURE IN THE NEW RETAIL ERA\\n2.1.\"Specialty stores + supermarket\" is the main, \"convenience stores + department stores\" is the auxiliary\\nDriven by artificial intelligence, the format structure in the new retail era presents some differences. As shown in\\nThe market sales structure is both happy and worried, and diversified business forms coexist development\\nIn terms of new retail formats market sales structure, specialty stores, convenience stores and department stores, such as commodity sales growth trend, and supermarkets formats market sales, commodity purchase and The total amount of goods purchased and the total amount of goods purchased for unified distribution showed a slight downward trend.However, from 2016 to 2018, driven by artificial intelligence, the new retail format presents the pattern of multiple formats co-development. Most retailers are no longer confined to one format. In addition to the steady development of the dominant format, they have made a reasonable combination of auxiliary formats.\\nThe development of regional business form is not balanced, show more than west less echelon structure\\nThe format structure in the new retail era is usually related to the level of local economic development. [4]The eastern coastal areas have more new retail resources than the central and western regions and the northeast regions, while the western regions have scarce and backward retail resources.From figure 1, 2016 east high of 50 \\nGet Immediate Access to Insights Research and Markets’ range of market research reports give you instant access to the latest market data and emerging trends for your industry.

Existing solution recommendation methods for online customer service are unable to determine the best solutions at runtime, leading to poor satisfaction of end customers. This paper proposes a novel intelligent framework, called ICS-Assist, to recommend suitable customer service solutions for service staff at runtime. Specifically, we develop a generalizable two-stage machine learning model to identify customer service scenarios and determine customer service solutions based on a scenario-solution mapping table. A novel knowledge distillation network called \"Panel-Student is proposed to derive a small yet efficient distilled learning model. We implement ICS-Assist and evaluate it using an over 6-month field study with Alibaba Group. In our experiment, over 12,000 customer service staff use ICS-Assist to serve for over 230,000 cases per day on average. The experimental results show that ICS-Assist significantly outperforms the traditional manual method, and improves the solution acceptance rate, the solution coverage rate, the average service time, the customer satisfaction rate, and the business domain catering rate by up to 16%, 25%, 6%, 14% and 17% respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\\nIntroduction\\nLarge e-commerce businesses such as Alibaba and Amazon provide hundreds of thousands of customer services to end customers via conversations every day, and these customer service conversations contain several topics, such as refunds, delivering inquiries, and instructions for using lucky money [23]. When end customers make inquiries through online customer service, they usually demand their requirements and intentions be addressed as fast as possible [14]. These requirements and intentions are usually versatile. As such, customer service solutions should be provided at runtime and should be able to correctly and timely address customers\\' requirements and intentions. For instance, when a customer calls in to complain about the poor quality of her newly bought shoes, we must recognize her intention of \"returning the shoes\" and provide her with the solution of how to return the shoes and apply for the refund [14].\\nCustomer service solutions can be determined either manually or automatically. Determining customer service solutions manually is flexible and humancentric, and the representatives need to have enough expert knowledge to handle all types of customer problems [18]. Several existing automated mechanisms have required expert knowledge learned from rich transaction history data to target most customer requirements. However, these approaches are inaccurate, inefficient and unsatisfactory, and most critically they are unable to generalize for diverse business domains [20]. As such, end customers\\' satisfaction will be significantly affected, and business quality and profits will also be further influenced.\\nIn this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based approach, called ICS-Assist, to facilitate customer service staff to identify ideal customer service solutions at runtime. ICS-Assist uses a two-stage learning model, coarse-grained learning and fine-grained learning, to identify the proper service scenario of each query made by the end customer. Moreover, ICS-Assist uses multi-aspect features (i.e. multi-round conversations, customer profiles, staff profiles, and order details) as the inputs to train a deep learning model for fine-grained service scenario recognition. Then ICS-Assist further determines the final solutions based on the \"scenario-solution\" mapping table constructed by business operators. The main differences between our approach and existing methods are: 1) Our approach can achieve accurate customer service scenario recognition at runtime \\n1h Free Analyst Time Speak directly to the analyst to clarify any post sales queries you may have.   Imagine wearing a pair of glasses with the computing power of a smartphone, activated by your voice, which recognizes what you see, where you are, and the context in which you are operating. While such a world is some years away from reality, first-mover advantage in AR is such a valuable prize that every large technology company is investing significantly in this theme. Ultimately, AR technology may replace the smartphone as the primary connected device users carry around. Moreover, AR will be a critical component of the metaverse - the next mega-theme that Big Tech has in its sights. Key Highlights   The AR market, worth $7bn in 2020, will generate revenues of $152bn by 2030, according to the publisher estimates. Clearly, the threat to the smartphone market is not imminent. Indeed, smartphones are used to support AR applications in both the consumer and enterprise markets. AR is evolving into a utility in specific consumer and enterprise applications. On the consumer front, AR is primarily used in social media, gaming, and ecommerce. While Pokémon Go and Snapchat Lenses have helped popularize AR as a tool for entertainment, ecommerce is using it as a utility. In addition, upcoming metaverse platforms will integrate AR-related technologies, helping to bring AR to the fore. In a the publisher survey conducted in Q2 2021, respondents perceived AR as the most disruptive technology, ahead of artificial intelligence. COVID-19 has fueled enterprise adoption of AR across sectors such as healthcare, law enforcement, and manufacturing, mainly for remote collaboration. Businesses will continue to adopt AR in the coming years, but the high cost of headsets and smart glasses will be a barrier to widespread adoption in the short term. However, by 2030, enterprises will account for the largest share of the AR market by revenue.   Scope   This report provides an overview of the augmented reality theme. It identifies the key trends impacting growth of the theme over the next 12 to 24 months, split into four categories: technology trends, macroeconomic trends, regulatory trends, and media trends.

However, making purchasing decisions in physical stores can be challenging due to a large number of similar alternatives and limited accessibility of the relevant product information (e.g., features, ratings, and reviews). In this work, we present ARShopping: a web-based prototype to visually communicate detailed product information from an online setting on portable smart devices (e.g., phones, tablets, glasses), within the physical space at the point of purchase. This prototype uses augmented reality (AR) to identify products and display detailed information to help consumers make purchasing decisions that fulfill their needs while decreasing the decision-making time. In particular, we use a data fusion algorithm to improve the precision of the product detection; we then integrate AR visualizations into the scene to facilitate comparisons across multiple products and features. We designed our prototype based on interviews with 14 participants to better understand the utility and ease of use of the prototype.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nPurchasing decisions are often influenced by the product information provided at the point of sale [29]. As online shopping becomes more popular, consumers increasingly rely on the comprehensive and precise product information available online (e.g., detailed product features, historical reviews, price trends, etc.) to make purchasing decisions [18]. For example, consumers on a diet usually need to review and compare the nutrition information of their groceries to select foods that best fit their nutrition goals. When online shopping, the shopping context and product information can be easily retrieved from the product database and web logs; many prior systems have therefore used this information to help online shoppers make better purchase decisions and provide product recommendations [2,20,32]. The situation of in-store purchases, however, introduces new challenges for retrieving and displaying product information on site.\\nRecent advancements in augmented reality (AR) provide new opportunities to bridge online product information with physical in-store products, and better communicate information to support comparisons and help shoppers make faster purchasing decisions. Existing work has explored the use of augmented reality in product information retrieval [9,11,27], shopping navigation [12,25], and real-time product recommendation [1], which are all demonstrated * e-mail: jenny.xu@u.northwestern.edu † e-mail: {sguo, eunyee, jhoffs, rrossi, fdu}@adobe.com to be helpful in improving consumers\\' in-store shopping experience. However, most existing AR applications focus on detecting one product at a time, while consumers in physical stores are often exposed to many similar product alternatives [19] and expected to make a reasonable decision between them. In addition, customers may need to consider multiple factors to make purchasing decisions (e.g., nutrition, price, ratings, etc.). Thus, there is a need for future AR systems to better support decision-making by facilitating comparisons of multiple products across multiple relevant features.\\nIn this work, we contribute a web-based prototype, ARShopping, for augmenting the in-store shopping experience with online product information (e.g., product features, ratings, etc.) through portable smart devices (e.g., phones, tablets, glasses).

This thematic research report takes an in-depth look at the theme of VR and the impact it has on the tourism industry. The report covers both positive and negative trends which the technology has created in the industry and in general. Insight into business and consumer attitudes on VR and a unique thematic analysis on the impact of the technology is provided, including recommendations for travel &amp; tourism companies. Additionally, we highlight the tourism companies involved with utilizing VR in their operations. “VR offers the potential to create substitute experiences that may be extremely useful for heritage and natural preservation” - Ralph Hollister - Travel &amp; Tourism Associate Analyst, the author  Key Highlights     The technology is currently being focused on in the pre-travel stage of the tourist journey due to the aesthetic appeal it can provide, which coincides well with marketing operations. VR also has the potential to impact the tourist’s experience post-trip, which is a stage in the tourist journey that is still relatively untouched by the impact of VR. Intermediaries and online travel companies are starting to explore virtual booking interfaces that can be experienced through a headset, relinquishing the need for a computer mouse or touch screen during the booking process. 5G will enable historic and heritage attractions to be brought back to life, and potentially create tourism surges in destinations which contain them. As mentioned previously, this updated technology offers high bandwidth, low latency and edge computing that provides complex overlays and animations that helps to bring to life historic attractions that have now become dilapidated over time or have diminished completely. As Gen Z becomes older and starts to occupy higher paid positions within organizations, their spending power will increase and their stronger preference for VR technology will mean that tourism organizations will have to increase VR’s involvement in their offerings, especially in the marketing process.

Hollebeek, Sunway University, Malaysia1 \\nDr. Nisreen Ameen, Royal Holloway University of London, UK\\nProfessor Rob Law, University of Macau, Macao SAR, China\\n VSI Motivation and Focus \\nGenerative AI (GAI) is an artificial intelligence sub-type that is able to generate original content, including images, text, audio, and code, by learning from (large) data (Peres et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023). It, therefore, stands as a ground-breaking technology capable of identifying data patterns and using those patterns to generate new content in response to specific content inputs (e.g., users’ questions). Remarkably, its output mirrors the quality that is typically associated with human experts, yet it is accomplished in a fraction of the time and at a significantly reduced cost, coupled with augmented creativity (Xie-Carson et al., 2023; Berente et al., 2021), thus potentially revolutionizing the creation, consumption, and delivery of tourism services (Li et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2023; Ameen et al., 2023). Specifically, GAI may be leveraged to personalize tourism offerings or their (e.g., marketing) content, among others, in turn boosting their competitiveness, effectiveness, or performance (Law et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022; Qiang &amp; McCabe, 2021). For example, while Expedia is using GAI to generate personalized travel itineraries for its customers (FastCompany, 2023), KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is using GAI to personalize its marketing campaigns (Diginomica, 2023).\\nHowever, despite its promise, GAI also raises potential ethical issues, including in terms of its accountability (e.g., by creating misleading/deceptive content), privacy, fairness, discrimination, or other biases that may impact tourism stakeholders (Xiang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). For example, GAI may generate content that inadvertently reinforces prevailing stereotypes, discriminates against specific (e.g., race, gender, or ethnic) demographics based on the data and/or algorithm it has been trained on (Dwivedi et al., 2023; Pazzanese, 2020), in turn exacerbating societal disparities or raising other ethical issues (Kim et al., 2023; Dogru et al., 2023a/b). Moreover, lacking transparency around the informational sources leveraged by GAI may raise concerns regarding the validity of its output (e.g., by questioning the reasoning behind GAI recommendations). For example, GAI may manipulate online hotel/restaurant reviews or mass-create false identity accounts. Consequently, its capacity to create misleading, obsolete, or misconstrued information may trigger the development of negative attitudes to GAI or GAI misconceptions that may adversely influence tourism stakeholders’ GAI-related decision-making, engagement, and/or wellbeing (Hollebeek &amp; Belk, 2021; He et al., 2018).\\nHowever, scholarly attention to the dynamics characterizing these potential ethical GAI challenges, and responsible GAI adoption, in tourism lags behind, exposing an important literature-based gap. In other words, scholars require an in-depth understanding of the ethical implications of tourism-based GAI design, adoption, and usage, along with relevant guidelines and best practices for responsible GAI implementation, as, therefore, addressed in this VSI. This VSI thus provides a platform to explore the interface of tourism, GAI, and ethics to boost tourism provider performance.\\nWe invite submissions that explore key hallmarks, drivers, consequences, and/or contingency factors characterizing tourism-based GAI design, adoption, and usage, thus moving the field of tourism management forward by contributing to its theoretical/methodological and practical advancement. We welcome qualitative, quantitative, or pluralistic contributions that make a substantive theoretical contribution and that address issues, including, but not limited to, the following:\\nWhat key ethical challenges characterize tourism-based GAI design, adoption, usage, and engagement and how can these be minimized or resolved?\\nWhat (e.g., security/privacy) measures may be implemented to protect users’ data (e.g., travel preferences or booking details) from unauthorized GAI access and/or misuse?\\nWhat tourism stakeholder roles, skills, and responsibilities are required to secure responsible GAI adoption and usage?\\nHow can responsible tourism-based GAI design be leveraged to boost specific tourism stakeholders’ (e.g., customers’ or employees’) engagement, trust, co-creation, satisfaction, or wellbeing?\\nHow can GAI be used to responsibly strengthen tourism stakeholder (e.g., customer) relationships?\\nTo what extent and how can tourism-based GAI be used to identify and combat tourismrelated mis- or disinformation (e.g., fake reviews)?\\nHow may GAI be leveraged to raise inclusion, diversity, and equity of specific stakeholders’ (e.g., customers’) tourism experiences (e.g., by making relevant tourismrelated recommendations?\\nHow should tourism-based GAI be governed (e.g., to minimize the emergence of monopolistic practices, to allow smaller, resource-constrained providers to still flourish)?\\nHow can GAI be used to support organizational, environmental, social, and governance (E.S.G.), or other responsible (e.g., sustainable) firm objectives?\\nWhat key implications does tourism-based GAI implementation have for tourism policymaking,\\nWhat are the key legal and policymaking implications of tourism-based GAI implementation?\\nHow will GAI adoption affect tourism scholarship and practice?\\n Submission Procedure \\nInterested authors are encouraged to submit a 500-word abstract of their work to Dr Jacky Cheah (email: j.cheah@uea.ac.uk and Dr Nisreen Ameen (email: nisreen.ameen@rhul.ac.uk by April 15, 2024, which members of the Guest Editor team will provide feedback on.

Hollebeek, Sunway University, Malaysia1\\n* Dr. Nisreen Ameen, Royal Holloway University of London, UK\\n* Professor Rob Law, University of Macau, Macao SAR, China\\nVSI Motivation and Focus\\nGenerative AI (GAI) is an artificial intelligence sub-type that is able to generate original content, including images, text, audio, and code, by learning from (large) data (Peres et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023). It, therefore, stands as a ground-breaking technology capable of identifying data patterns and using those patterns to generate new content in response to specific content inputs (e.g., users’ questions). Remarkably, its output mirrors the quality that is typically associated with human experts, yet it is accomplished in a fraction of the time and at a significantly reduced cost, coupled with augmented creativity (Xie-Carson et al., 2023; Berente et al., 2021), thus potentially revolutionizing the creation, consumption, and delivery of tourism services (Li et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2023; Ameen et al., 2023). Specifically, GAI may be leveraged to personalize tourism offerings or their (e.g., marketing) content, among others, in turn boosting their competitiveness, effectiveness, or performance (Law et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022; Qiang & McCabe, 2021). For example, while Expedia is using GAI to generate personalized travel itineraries for its customers (FastCompany, 2023), KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is using GAI to personalize its marketing campaigns (Diginomica, 2023).\\nHowever, despite its promise, GAI also raises potential ethical issues, including in terms of its accountability (e.g., by creating misleading/deceptive content), privacy, fairness, discrimination, or other biases that may impact tourism stakeholders (Xiang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). For example, GAI may generate content that inadvertently reinforces prevailing stereotypes, discriminates against specific (e.g., race, gender, or ethnic) demographics based on the data and/or algorithm it has been trained on (Dwivedi et al., 2023; Pazzanese, 2020), in turn exacerbating societal disparities or raising other ethical issues (Kim et al., 2023; Dogru et al., 2023a/b). Moreover, lacking transparency around the informational sources leveraged by GAI may raise concerns regarding the validity of its output (e.g., by questioning the reasoning behind GAI recommendations). For example, GAI may manipulate online hotel/restaurant reviews or mass-create false identity accounts. Consequently, its capacity to create misleading, obsolete, or misconstrued information may trigger the development of negative attitudes to GAI or GAI misconceptions that may adversely influence tourism stakeholders’ GAI-related decision-making, engagement, and/or wellbeing (Hollebeek & Belk, 2021; He et al., 2018).\\nHowever, scholarly attention to the dynamics characterizing these potential ethical GAI challenges, and responsible GAI adoption, in tourism lags behind, exposing an important literature-based gap. In other words, scholars require an in-depth understanding of the ethical implications of tourism-based GAI design, adoption, and usage, along with relevant guidelines and best practices for responsible GAI implementation, as, therefore, addressed in this VSI. This VSI thus provides a platform to explore the interface of tourism, GAI, and ethics to boost tourism provider performance.\\nWe invite submissions that explore key hallmarks, drivers, consequences, and/or contingency factors characterizing tourism-based GAI design, adoption, and usage, thus moving the field of tourism management forward by contributing to its theoretical/methodological and practical advancement. We welcome qualitative, quantitative, or pluralistic contributions that make a substantive theoretical contribution and that address issues, including, but not limited to, the following:\\n* What key ethical challenges characterize tourism-based GAI design, adoption, usage, and engagement and how can these be minimized or resolved?\\n* What (e.g., security/privacy) measures may be implemented to protect users’ data (e.g., travel preferences or booking details) from unauthorized GAI access and/or misuse?\\n* What tourism stakeholder roles, skills, and responsibilities are required to secure responsible GAI adoption and usage?\\n* How can responsible tourism-based GAI design be leveraged to boost specific tourism stakeholders’ (e.g., customers’ or employees’) engagement, trust, co-creation, satisfaction, or wellbeing?\\n* How can GAI be used to responsibly strengthen tourism stakeholder (e.g., customer) relationships?\\n* To what extent and how can tourism-based GAI be used to identify and combat tourismrelated mis- or disinformation (e.g., fake reviews)?\\n* How may GAI be leveraged to raise inclusion, diversity, and equity of specific stakeholders’ (e.g., customers’) tourism experiences (e.g., by making relevant tourismrelated recommendations?\\n* How should tourism-based GAI be governed (e.g., to minimize the emergence of monopolistic practices, to allow smaller, resource-constrained providers to still flourish)?\\n* How can GAI be used to support organizational, environmental, social, and governance (E.S.G.), or other responsible (e.g., sustainable) firm objectives?\\n* What key implications does tourism-based GAI implementation have for tourism policymaking,\\n* What are the key legal and policymaking implications of tourism-based GAI implementation?\\n* How will GAI adoption affect tourism scholarship and practice?\\nSubmission Procedure\\nInterested authors are encouraged to submit a 500-word abstract of their work to Dr Jacky Cheah (email: j.cheah@uea.ac.uk and Dr Nisreen Ameen (email: nisreen.ameen@rhul.ac.uk by April 15, 2024, which members of the Guest Editor team will provide feedback on.

The effective management of tourism resource information is an urgent problem to be solved at present. Traditional tourism information management adopts two-dimensional spatial data, which can no longer meet the needs of tourism development and tourists. Therefore, it is of great significance to establish 3D visual tourism scenes. As an information-intensive industry, virtual tourism based on virtual reality (VR) can not only improve the information level of the whole industry, but also promote the protection of natural and human tourism resources. This article takes experience as the path to study the emotional transformation mechanism of tourism interactive products, explores the deep features of product images with deep learning (DL) algorithm, and introduces interactive experience thinking into the research of tourism interactive product design, aiming at improving the interactive experience of tourism interactive products and expanding the research scope of computer-aided design (CAD). This method can give designers great help to specific problems, but only one method is adopted, which can only support a certain type of innovation. With the deepening of the research on innovation, the innovation problems are classified and classified, and appropriate strategies are adopted respectively.The online experience of Aibiying may be welcomed and loved by many travelers. Cenni and Vásquez [4] use virtual reality technology to allow users to truly experience the environment, culture, and customs of tourist destinations, and gain an early understanding of the appearance,\\nINTRODUCTION\\nTourism has become a mass consumer product, but with the increase of demand, the richness of travel routes and the diversification of tourists\\' needs, tourists\\' satisfaction with tourism services is gradually declining. Based on the rapid growth of social economy and the sharp improvement of people\\'s living standards, consumers\\' demand for products has also changed from functional demand to emotional demand; Therefore, tourism product design no longer only pursues functional realization and product practicality, but also needs consumers to realize spiritual satisfaction and emotional care in the stage of product experience. Virtual reality technology has been widely applied in many fields in recent years, including tourism. This technology can provide an immersive virtual travel experience, allowing people to explore scenic spots around the world without having to go there in person. However, virtual reality technology also brings a complex problem: it limits human interaction in tourism. How does this restriction affect the tourism experience and human interaction? This is the issue that we need to explore. ATSIZ [1] reviewed the application of virtual reality technology in the tourism field and its impact on human interaction. Virtual reality technology provides new ways to experience tourism, but it also limits the physical distance between people. We explored the impact of this restriction on tourism experience and human interaction, and proposed future research directions. It was found that although virtual reality technology provides an immersive travel experience, it also limits human interaction. This restriction may have a negative impact on the tourism experience as it deprives people of genuine interaction with local culture, people, and geographical environment. However, we also need to recognize that virtual reality technology itself is not good or bad, it is just a tool. How to reasonably utilize this technology to balance the needs of virtual tourism experience and human interaction is a question worth exploring. The revolution of VR has caused a double change in human life style and way of thinking. A virtual world, which is different from human reality but closely related to it, is gradually entering human life, becoming a brand-new antenna for rapidly exploring the world today. Baik [2] conducted a virtual 3D model analysis of architectural heritage information model. It constructs an augmented reality architecture cloud data restoration system in a 3D environment. Interactive virtual BIM allows tourists to interact with the virtual environment, such as exploring, clicking, and dragging in the virtual environment. This interactivity and sense of participation can enhance the experience of tourists, making them feel more authentic and immersive. Interactive virtual BIM can provide personalized travel experiences based on the interests and needs of tourists. For example, tourists can choose the attractions they are interested in, or visit according to their preferences and schedule. Interactive virtual BIM can be used to promote and protect heritage sites in Jeddah \\nHome \\n Press Release \\nGlobal Digital Human Avatar Market\\n Digital Human Avatar Market Size Worth USD 561.16 Billion in 2032 \\n \\n Increasing effort by customer-centric companies is a major factor driving global digital human avatar market revenue growth \\n  Market Size – USD 29.51 Billion in 2022, Market Growth – at a CAGR of 34.2%, Market Trends – Growing media &amp; entertainment industry  \\n Vancouver, B.C., July 21, 2023  - The global digital human avatar market size is expected to reach USD 561.16 Billion in 2032 and register a revenue CAGR of 34.2% during the forecast period, according to the latest analysis by Emergen Research. Growing media &amp; entertainment industry can be attributed with the steady market revenue growth. With the rapid growth of media and entertainment industry, digital human usage is projected to increase, which is expected to drive revenue growth of the digital human avatar market over the forecast period. For instance, on January 2023, ColorDigital, a German company, has partnered with its digital platform DMIx to introduce a collection of customizable virtual avatars. The primary objective behind this launch is to promote an end-to-end digital workflow for fashion brands. In collaboration with Verce, ColorDigital has developed two products: DMIx StudioAvatars and DMIx 3D-Studio. These products aim to facilitate sustainable production practices while also advocating for diversity and representation within fashion industry. By leveraging these virtual avatars, fashion brands can streamline their workflows and contribute to more sustainable and inclusive practices.\\nThe market revenue growth is expected to be restrained by a lack of understanding about the benefits of digital human avatars. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) gains traction in the business sector, many firms are looking for areas where technologies such as machine learning and deep learning can provide a competitive advantage. Customer service automation is one of the most promising use cases; in recent years, numerous businesses have created avatars that can assist organizations in relieving burden on their customer care workers and engaging with customers at scale. However, some people are skeptical of AI, and it can be difficult to get customers comfortable with the idea of connecting with new technology, especially if they feel obligated to speak with an impersonal application interface when they will be communicating with a human.   \\n \\n Some Key Highlights From the Report \\nOn 9 March 2023, Pantheon Lab, an AI startup based in Hong Kong, believes that AI-generated digital human avatars have the potential to be valuable in various industries, not only in Hong Kong but also beyond. This comes as there is growing public interest in advanced AI services, such as ChatGPT, that offer sophisticated conversational capabilities. Pantheon Lab aims to tap into this trend and offer AI-generated avatars to traditional industries, leveraging the potential of advanced AI technologies.\\nThe interactive digital human avatar segment is expected to account for largest revenue share in the global market over the forecast period owing to companies working on various Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities, product launches, and making innovations in existing product lines. For example, on July 5, 2023, NTT DATA announced imminent release of their ShotView technology, which would be backed by digital twin technology. ShotView incorporates millions of data points from the course in an interactive context to provide unmatched insights into the live golfing experience. NTT DATA will also present its latest AI-powered digital human platform, Lottie, at the event. Lottie will act as an educational and amusing guide for visitors, providing information about the event, participants, and sport itself, as well as guiding spectators with course navigation. NTT DATA\\'s digital human platform adds a human touch to the standard self-service interface by employing a lifelike digital avatar that duplicates human movement, sound, gestures, body language, facial emotions, and tone of voice.\\nThe entertainment segment is expected to account for largest revenue share in the global market over the forecast period. Digital human avatars provide entertainment makers unprecedented creative freedom and control. To meet their creative vision, filmmakers and animators can modify and fine-tune the look, behavior, and narrative arcs of these avatars. This adaptability enables the study of varied storytelling styles, character development, and imaginative worlds that would be difficult or costly to accomplish using traditional methods. Artists, animators, and performers can collaborate remotely using digital human avatars, allowing them to work from separate places. This worldwide accessibility dissolves geographical barriers and promotes cross-cultural partnerships, resulting in different and enhanced narrative experiences. In the entertainment industry, digital human avatars provide unique prospects for longer audience connection and commercialization. Fans can interact with their favorite characters through virtual experiences, virtual meet-and-greets, and virtual meet-and-greets.\\nThe digital human avatar market in North America accounted for largest revenue share in 2022. Factors such as increasing activities by leading market players, such as new releases and product expansions, among others, are driving revenue growth of the market in this region. Ogilvy, for example, launched Reality, a specialized digital experience ‘lab’ geared at investigating and creating novel uses of technology such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Dickon Laws, Ogilvy\\'s global head of innovation, will lead the studio, which will serve as a ‘innovation translator, pathfinder, and risk navigator’ for network customers. Laws predicts that the market for the studio\\'s technological skills will be worth USD 1.5 trillion by the end of the decade.\\nSome major companies in the global market report include Tencent Holdings Limited, Nvidia Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Netease, Inc., Epic Games, Inc., Roblox Corporation, Didimo Inc., Wolf3D, Hour One, Spatial Systems, Inc.\\n To get leading market solutions, visit the link below: https://www.emergenresearch.com/industry-report/digital-human-avatar-market  \\nFor the purpose of this report, Emergen Research has segmented the global digital human avatar market based on the product type, industry verticals, and region:\\n Product Type Outlook (Revenue, USD Billion;

Significant advancements in the field of VRGIS and its usage in research have been made as a result of the use of VRGIS to categorize, assess, plan, and manage tourism resources. The analysis of the recent development of VRGIS in tourism resource research is the first section of this work. This study examines and implements a mobile, computerized, and intelligent tourism service system that gives visitors a sense of the surrounding landscape using VRGIS. Three-dimensional mapping, environment detection, personal trajectory, and Weibo sharing are just a few of the system\\'s many helpful features. While travelling, tourists can get services that are more intelligent and practical. The drawbacks of conventional geographic information systems include their reliance on sophisticated models, network limitations, and operational challenges. New software architecture is put in place to get rid of network restrictions, virtual reality peripherals are used to make operation more convenient, and system modeling is rebuilt using the TIN data model and model simplification. The results of experiments show improved refresh rates and peripheral expansion modules. The user experience is enhanced by this research.\\nIntroduction\\nThe tourism industry has become an essential driver of growth in a great number of nations, and the tourism resources that are available are an essential component of the material foundation on which the tourism sector is built and maintained [1,2]. In order to provide a fundamental basis for the evaluation, planning, and reasonable protection of tourism resources, it is essential to recognize, classify, collect, and build a database of tourism resources. This is carried out in order to provide a fundamental basis. As a result of the one-of-a-kind qualities of tourism resources, the theory and methods of VRGIS are one-of-a-kind when it comes to spatial cognition and the design of classification systems, as well as the standardization of databases, as well as spatial analysis and evaluation analysis [3][4][5]. It is now an accepted method and an integral part of the entire process of researching, developing, and making use of tourism resources that this practice has become a common place when carrying out research on tourism resources. The utilization of VRGIS in tourism research and application has important enlightenment significance for both the understanding of the theoretical and technical system and the guiding of the utilization of tourism resources [6].\\nSince the beginning of time, one of the most vital areas of research has been focused on the application of GIS in the process of developing and managing tourism resources. The study of tourism resources has made extensive use of GIS. In recent years, the tourism industry has begun to make use of geographic information systems, more commonly referred to as GIS. There is a strong connection between the theory and technology of GIS and the investigation and utilization of tourism resources [7][8][9]. The vast majority of researchers working in this area have concentrated their attention on the function of GIS in the cultivation and application of tourism resources; however, a few of them have also carried out pertinent review research in this sector. There is still a lack of systematic application of GIS in the development and management of tourism resources, which leads to issues such as a lack of application and a lack of understanding of application fields. One solution to this problem is to increase the use of GIS in tourism resource development and management [10][11][12].\\nDue to the rapid advancement of information technology in the modern world, the current trend toward the informatization of tourism involves the extensive application of cutting-edge technologies such as VRGIS. Due to advancements in mobile Internet technology, high-speed networks are becoming more portable, which contributes to their growing popularity. The integration of smartphones with information search, communication, entertainment, and social networking provides users with access to dynamic information services and personalized recommendation \\nJeff Baker jbaker@aus.edu\\nSchool of Business Administration\\nAmerican University of Sharjah\\nSharjahUnited Arab Emirates\\nKichan Nam knam@aus.edu\\nSchool of Business Administration\\nAmerican University of Sharjah\\nSharjahUnited Arab Emirates\\nChristopher S Dutt 0000-0003-0219-0277\\nAl Rayyan International University College\\nDohaQatar\\nA user experience perspective on heritage tourism in the metaverse: Empirical evidence and design dilemmas for VR\\n7 August 20230B10A6FA794B7636C8E9F82FA2CF6EF810.1007/s40558-023-00256-xReceived: 28 February 2023 / Revised: 29 June 2023 / Accepted: 24 July 2023 /Virtual Reality (VR)MetaverseUser experienceHeritage tourismInterview\\nThe tourism industry will be shaped by the growth and development of the metaverse in the coming decades.Virtual reality (VR) will enable the creation of virtual worlds, avatars, digital twins, and new social networks.These technologies can be utilized in tourism to enable travelers to preview real-world experiences, to enhance experiences while on-site, to relive experiences after travel, or in some cases to even substitute for travel.Given the metaverse\\'s transformative potential, empirical investigation of VR is clearly warranted.Studies of VR tourism typically choose a single specific VR application and investigate its impact on adoption or user satisfaction.This application-level focus is a significant limitation.We therefore evaluate multiple heritage tourism applications as well as VR hardware in a comprehensive and structured analysis from the user experience (UX) perspective.Our content analysis of user interviews reveals 13 factors that shape users\\' overall perceptions about VR.These factors are grouped into categories related to presentation of the VR content, the content itself, and the functionality of the hardware and software.Our analysis also reveals three design dilemmas for creators of VR heritage tourism content for the metaverse.Implications and an agenda for future research are included.\\nIntroduction\\nTechnology has and will continue to disrupt operational practices for business the world over (Buhalis et al. 2023;Gursoy et al. 2022).In the virtual reality (VR) space, this will proceed as the metaverse attracts more interest and investment.The metaverse refers to a 3D virtual shared world where all activities can be carried out with the help of augmented and virtual reality services (Damar 2021, p. 1).It is \" a shared online space that incorporates three-dimensional graphics, either on a screen or in virtual reality\" (Sparkes 2021, p. 18).In tourism, the metaverse is seen as a platform through which greater experiences can be offered to travelers before, during, and after their travels, while also facilitating interactions in the virtual world (Buhalis et al. 2023;Dwivedi et al. 2022;Koo et al. 2022).\\nWhile the development of the metaverse is in its early stages, supporting technologies such as VR apps and VR headsets (formally known as HMDs, headmounted devices), are becoming more common.Recent statistics suggest that the VR market is worth US$6 billion and is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 25% over the next 10 years (GlobalData 2022).The number of HMDs is estimated to grow from around 20 million units in 2020 to over 60 million by 2026 (The Economist 2022).There has been a 14% increase in the number of VR start-ups in less than one year, with 75% of Forbes\\' \"Most Valuable Brands\" using either VR or AR (Blagojević 2023).By 2030, VR is anticipated to influence over 20 million jobs and contribute US$1.9 trillion to the global economy (Blagojević 2023).These statistics point towards rapid growth and adoption of VR technology throughout business and society in industries as diverse as healthcare, education, defense, entertainment, logistics, manufacturing, and tourism (Blagojević 2023).\\nIn tourism, VR complements travel by supporting users\\' travel planning (Guttentag 2010) and facilitating access to hard-to-reach or environmentally sensitive destinations (Egger 2016; W. Lee and Kim 2021).Travelers may plan to use the metaverse and its associated VR systems to replace, complement, or enhance their experiences (Egger 2016;Guttentag 2010;W. Lee and Kim 2021).In light of these trends, it is important to examine how users will react to and adopt metaverse technologies.\\nWhen examining technologies \\nQiao Sui\\nDepartment of Design and Manufacturing Engineering\\nJeonbuk National University\\n54896JeonjuRepublic of Korea\\nCollege of Network and Information Security\\nJiangsu College of Safety Technology\\n221011XuzhouJiangsuChina\\nLi Sui\\nHuaiyin Middle School\\nHuai\\'an223001JiangsuChina\\nZhenzhen Dong\\nIntelligent Manufacturing College\\nZhanjiang University of Science and Technology\\n524000ZhanjiangGuangdongChina\\nKai Lu\\nDepartment of Design and Manufacturing Engineering\\nJeonbuk National University\\n54896JeonjuRepublic of Korea\\nSchool of Media and Arts\\nWuxi University\\n214000WuxiJiangsuChina\\nthe Design of VR Tourism Service System Based on Deep Learning and Emotional Experience\\nPublished 30 March 202210.1155/2022/6097834Received 18 February 2022; Revised 10 March 2022; Accepted 11 March 2022;Research Article Research on Correspondence should be addressed to Kai Lu; Academic Editor: Gengxin Sun\\nVR tourism has become an important part of mass tourism. With the advent of the \"VR +\" era and changes in public consumption habits, tourism must integrate VR, AR and other new technological means of high-quality development and innovative transformation and upgrading. Firstly, the concept of VR + tourism is clarified, and then the biggest problem in the current tourism development is the lack of application of new technologies and the lack of professional talents for local needs. For tourism enterprises, service providers, tourists, service facilities and scenarios, and service processes are all key elements in the implementation of emotional experiences. Possible elements of emotional experience in tourism services include designing attractive tourism experience themes, enhancing the experience value of tourism services, displaying experiential tourism tangibles, creating an atmosphere for interactive tourism experiences, and attaching importance to sensory stimulation for tourists.\\nIntroduction\\nWith the rapid spread and application of 5G, artificial intelligence and big data, virtual reality (VR) technology is being rapidly promoted and applied in all walks of life. In recent years, virtual reality companies have introduced a variety of VR tourism materials and actively promoted them as practical teaching resources for tourism majors in major universities, which are expensive and limited to famous attractions [1].\\nVR + tourism is a new paradigm where the integration of virtual reality technology can bring a new and exciting experience to visitors. is allows visitors to walk around the virtual space and view the scenery in a 360 degree view, which is visually no less impressive than viewing the scenery in the field. Wearing virtual reality equipment can also enhance the experience of hearing, smelling and touching, so even if you use virtual reality equipment to watch the scenery, you will not find it boring. [2].\\nIn the current society, more and more geeks and nerds are eating, drinking and playing without going out, and \"otaku\" has become synonymous with a new generation of young people. \"VR + tourism has brought new travel experiences to people at home and has brought them into close contact with their favourite landscapes. At present, China\\'s virtual tourism is still mainly focused on panoramic displays, from the traditional single picture viewing into 360-degree real-world appreciation, lack of immersive experience [3]. And because of the inclusion of three-dimensional modelling and threedimensional animation technology production of virtual tourism due to the very high cost of development, the development of the difficulty, VR + tourism popular application is low [4].\\nTourism is essentially a service industry, or more accurately, a mixture of service industries. As Faulkner, (1998) states \"tourism is a collection of complementary services for a specific destination\" [5]. In the case of services, while the traditional management areas of quality and productivity are important, these are merely what Crompton calls the \\'technical part\\'. e other side of the management equation is the \\'psychological environment\\', the subjective personal reactions and feelings that consumers experience when consuming a service.\\nis phenomenon is known as the service experience and in recent years has been found to be a very important part of consumers\\' evaluation of service satisfaction [6]. In the tourism industry, it is important to understand the phenomenon of experience in tourism because the behavioural decisions of travellers are often based on their emotional responses.\\nPhilip Kotler divided human consumption behaviour into three stages: quantitative satisfaction, qualitative satisfaction and emotional satisfaction. In the emotional satisfaction stage, consumers are not looking for quantity and quality, but for an emotional desire to match the product with their ideal self-concept [7]. e recognition of this consumer characteristic has led to the emergence of experiential marketing.

Today, tourism towns are booming in China, which gradually become new growth point of economy and new highlight of urban and rural overall development. This paper discusses tourism town construction with AI technology, analyses problems and shortcomings in tourism town Intelligence construction under present circumstance of smart tourism development and purposes ways and strategies to construct smart towns.\\nResearch Background\\nWhen it comes to smart cities, people tend to think about the Internet, the Internet of things, cloud computing, Big Data, mobile Internet and other applied technologies. However, AI technologies are overlooked, such as intelligent manufacturing, intelligent voice control, intelligent household electrical appliance, robots, intelligent terminal, AI, VR and others.\\nAI, also known as Artificial Intelligence, is a new interdisciplinary subject and intelligence technology developed from interpenetration of multiple subjects, such as computer science, cybernetics, information theory, psychology, linguistics and so on. It studies how machines, especially computers imitate and carry out human behaviors. After decades of development, AI technology grows in many fields and is applied to our daily life and learning process. AI can extract useful information from data sea. With features like fast process of information and high efficiency, AI provides supports to smarter decisions and activities, which can result in improving government public service, enterprises competitiveness and citizen life quality. Thus, it is like an intelligent road to smart cities.\\nAI Technology Applied in Intelligent Tourism\\nNetizens have become the main force in tourism market, whose consumption need for individualized, quality and experimental tourism urges the combined development of Big Data, AI technology and tourism service. New products and new type of business have resulted from it, such as customized tourism, micro tour guide service, intelligent visitors\\' guide. Technology now shares a very strong link with individualization and intelligence of tourism.\\nTourists\\' fragmentary needs during their trips are growing as well due to the fact that independent tourism has become the main way to tour for the public. At the same time, people now find pure sightseeing not enough and desire more of convenience and sense of achievement during the trip. Take outbound travel as an example. To overcome the language barrier which is usually seen in outbound travel, Baidu, Google, Youdao Translation, Iflytek and some other companies have developed AI technology, such as \"Picture Translation\", \"Voice Recognition\", \"AR Instant Translation\". Translation devices are more intelligent than ever, which makes outbound independent tourism easier. In addition, intelligent service, such as taking pictures for recognition and translation of words and visitors\\' guide, makes travelling more revitalized.\\nIn recent years, growth of tourism demographic dividend has slowed down; refined operation of stock market has become a new direction for market body to work toward. Many hotels and scenic spots uses AI technology to provide better experience for tourists, which is actually a main attraction for tourists. \"post-90s generation\" and \"post-2000 generation\" are taking over the main part of tourism market, whose need for intelligent, quality and experimental service drives hotels and scenic areas to apply AI technology more broadly. Those enterprises attempts to give tourists better check-in experiences by face recognition, intelligent tour guides and other high-tech. Scenic spots, museums, entertainment venues apply VR and AR to individualized quality experimental settings, attracting a great number of tourists. Some enterprises put robots in scenes and encourage visitors to interact, which meets the need for individualization and fashion. For example, in the exhibition area of Confucian Culture in Shandong Museum, there applies holography technology to present a sense in which tourists can ask Confucius for direction \\nThe Role of Human–Machine Interactive Devices for Post-COVID-19 Innovative Sustainable Tourism in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\\nPublisher: MDPI AG\\nDate Published: 2020-11-16\\nAuthors:\\nNguyen Thi Thanh Van, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education, 700000, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\\nVasiliki Vrana, International Hellenic University, 570 01, Thessaloniki, Greece, vrana@ihu.gr\\nNguyen Thien Duy, University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, 700000, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\\nDoan Xuan Huy Minh, SBI Building, Quang Trung Software City, Tan Chanh Hiep Ward, District 12, 700000, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\\nPham Tien Dzung\\nSubhra R Mondal, Teerthanker Mahaveer University, 244001, Moradabad, UP, India\\nSubhankar Das, Teerthanker Mahaveer University, 244001, Moradabad, UP, India\\nAbstract\\nIn this research article, we aim to study the proposed role of human-machine interactive (HMI) technologies, including both artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR)-enabled applications, for the post-COVID-19 revival of the already depleted tourism industry in Vietnam\\'s major tourist destination and business hub of Ho Chi Minh City. The researchers aim to gather practical knowledge regarding tourists\\' intentions for such service enhancements, which may drive the sector to adopt a better conclusive growth pattern in post-COVID-19 times. In this study, we attempt to focus on travelers who look for paramount safety with the assurance of empathetic, personalized care in post-COVID-19 times. In the current study, the authors employ structural equation modeling to evaluate the intentions of tourists both structurally and empirically for destination tourism with data collected from tourists with previous exposure to various kinds of these devices. The study shows that human-machine interactive devices are integrating AI and VR and have a significant effect on overall service quality, leading to tourist satisfaction and loyalty. The use of such social interactive gadgets within tourism and mostly in hospitality services requires an organization to make a commitment to futuristic technologies, along with building value by enriching service quality expectations among fearful tourists. This research shows that tourists mainly focus on the use of such HMI devices from the perspective of technology acceptance factors, qualitative value-enhancing service and trustworthy information-sharing mechanisms. The concept of the tour bubble framework is also discussed in detail. The analysis of this discussion gives us a more profound understanding of the novel opportunities which various administrative agencies may benefit from to position these devices better in smart, sustainable destination tourism strategies for the future so that, collectively, service 5.0 with HMI devices can possibly bring back tourism from being disintegrated. Such service applications are the new social innovations leading to sustainable service and a sophisticated experience for all tourists.\\n1. Introduction\\nCOVID-19 has been an unwelcome surprise globally. As COVID-19 has spread around the world, the services industry, which relies on direct human interaction, has suffered a great deal. Services such as tourism, hospitality and aviation have been the most impacted industries. The fear factor and the subsequent melancholic atmosphere have been psychologically affecting people around the world, and this will continue for some time in the future, even after a potential solution or cure for the disease is found [1] [2] [3].

Yet, despite significant technology advancements in areas like motion capture, graphics rendering, animation, and modeling, the technology that powers NPC behavior has remained stagnant.  For our Future of NPCs report, we surveyed over 1,000 gamers to find out what they love and hate about current NPCs – and what they crave from NPCs in the future.   Learn more why NPCs are so important to gamers and why intelligent NPCs are at the top of gamers’ wish lists. \\nView PDF  \\nAbstract:Virtual reality games always provide the player with the most verisimilitude experience. With the advancement of VR hardware, it may become mainstream how people feel and attach to a virtual world. The paper discusses a possible solution to finding a better balance between the two classical genres of VR games, sensory stimulation and storytelling. To this end, we designed a game named \"Bury Me Here,\" in which players can find an emotional bond between the game protagonist and themselves. The game includes four sections, the departure from the hometown, the travel on the train, the work in the office, and the life in the penthouse. At the game\\'s end, the protagonist returns to his country yard and spends the rest of his life there. All the sections are designed to tell a stranger\\'s life story to the player, making them experience someone else\\'s life path and bonding an emotional connection between the player and the protagonist through storytelling. Results show that the game provides an immersive visual experience and has emotive sparks echo in players\\' minds.\\n \\nSubmission history  From: Zhongsheng Li [view email]  [v1]\\nWed, 13 Mar 2024 18:46:50 UTC (7,567 KB) \\nOur research provides insight into the numerous sectors that benefit from interactive technology,  featuring detailed analysis of global market trends and key technologies. \\nFrom eSports to voice assistants our research answers the key questions such as:\\nWhat are the technologies that are driving growth?\\nWhat is the sizes of each market?\\nWhich sectors will present the greatest opportunities?\\nand more\\n See the market research and other resources we have available for the interactive technologies sectors: \\nReports\\n||||I|||| We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience.

The emergence of AI-generated Content (AIGC) is considered as a potential solution for efficient digital storytelling production. However, the specific form, effects, and impacts of this fusion remain unclear, leaving the boundaries of AIGC combined with storytelling undefined. This work explores the current integration state of AIGC and digital storytelling, investigates the artistic value of their fusion in a sample project, and addresses common issues through interviews. Through our study, we conclude that AIGC, while proficient in image creation, voiceover production, and music composition, falls short of replacing humans due to the irreplaceable elements of human creativity and aesthetic sensibilities at present, especially in complex character animations, facial expressions, and sound effects. The research objective is to increase public awareness of the current state, limitations, and challenges arising from combining AIGC and digital storytelling.\\n \\nSubmission history  From: Rongzhang Gu [view email]   [v1] \\nMon, 25 Sep 2023 17:54:29 UTC (13,192 KB)\\n[v2]\\nThu, 28 Sep 2023 04:32:07 UTC (13,192 KB)\\n  ||||I|||| Skip to main content\\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, member institutions , and all contributors.

During the storytelling process, a player can participate as a character in the story. Meanwhile, the behaviors of the virtual characters and the placement of the virtual items adapt to the player’s actions. An input raw story is represented as a sequence of events, which contain high-level descriptions of the characters’ states, and is converted into a graph representation with automatically supplemented low-level spatial details. Our hierarchical story sampling approach samples realistic character behaviors that fit the story contexts through optimizations; and an animator, which estimates and prioritizes the player’s actions, animates the virtual characters to tell the story in AR. Through experiments and a user study, we validated the effectiveness of our approach for AR storytelling in different environments.\\n Keywords: Augmented Reality, Storytelling, Character Animation\\n \\nPublication\\nChangyang Li,\\nWanwan Li,\\nHaikun Huang,\\nLap-Fai Yu\\nACM Transactions on Graphics (Proceeding of SIGGRAPH 2022)\\n[Main paper]\\n[Supplementary material]\\n[Code]\\n  \\nBibTex\\n@article{arstorytelling,\\ntitle={Interactive Augmented Reality Storytelling Guided by Scene Semantics},\\nauthor = {Changyang Li and Wanwan Li and Haikun Huang and Lap-Fai Yu},\\njournal = {ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)},\\nvolume = {41},\\nnumber = {4},\\nyear = {2022},\\npublisher={ACM New York, NY, USA}\\n}\\n \\nSome Experiment Results\\n Click on the images to make them bigger  \\n \\n 1 George Mason University\\n 2 University of South Florida'] market_size=0 growth_potential=0.0 key_characteristics=[]\n",

This report evaluates VR applications for the consumer and enterprise sectors for which we see gaming, education, and simulations training leading the way. The report assesses leading companies, strategies, products, and services. It provides analysis and forecasts for VR gaming, education, and simulations for 2021 through 2026. Select Report Findings:   5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming For training and instruction, we see everything from situational to more traditional expectations such as VR enhanced simulations for flight and vehicle training VR solution-focused offerings will focus upon very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training Edge computing will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases  We see fully immersive virtual reality systems gaining substantial market momentum in consumer markets within the next few years. These VR systems will provide an unprecedented digital experience for humans, often including multiple senses as well as interaction with virtual objects and/or interaction between the real and virtual worlds. In terms of the consumer segment, we see current VR gaming evolving from current offerings such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PlayStation VR to more sophisticated entertainment that involves elements of casual gaming combined with real-world interests involving the economy and social status. In many respects, VR gaming is a greenfield opportunity, which will bring many new market entrants into the fray as application and content providers aggressively compete to establish a loyal user base. For example, Skydance Interactive, a division of Skydance Media, has recently unveiled The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners, initially available on Oculus Rift, Rift S, Quest, and HTC Vive. Successful companies will be those that develop communities of interest based on game-play and follower dynamics including innovation in interactive e-sports entertainment, in-game reward systems, and real-world to VR gamification integration. Long-term success will be dependent upon game delivery platform, system, and connectivity independence. This will occur coincident with a few key trends in platform/network transformation and service delivery such as the shift from console to cloud supported platforms and 5G communications supported by edge computing. Some very compelling enterprise VR applications are anticipated to emerge over the next three to five years. Many of these will be solution-focused upon achieving very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training. Enterprise applications will extend beyond internal use and B2B as businesses embrace the use of VR to reach consumer markets. Real estate is a prime example where VR may be used for education-sales such as training new home buyers while simultaneously marketing properties. We see the virtual reality market gaining ground once 5G is more firmly in place commercially, but not entirely due to wireless VR. Instead, we see a massive build-out of broadband as a whole (due to competition from the 5G market) as one of the fundamental drivers for VR adoption. This will be driven in part by substantially greater availability of FTTX and HFC as well as greater bandwidth overall at lower costs. 5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming. Previously encumbered by a combination of technology gaps and consumer readiness issues, the virtual reality market is poised for substantive global growth, providing abundant opportunities for service providers, content developers, and ecosystem component providers. While today many apps and services within the XR universe are very device-dependent and network constrained, convergence is on the horizon from a device perspective as well as substantial opportunities through untethering via 5G and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). MEC will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases. This will be particularly the case for VR portability, and to some extent, mobility to the extent that there is good 5G coverage. Substantially lower latency facilitated by the combination of 5G and MEC will lead to many new and enhanced applications. For example, VR-based telepresence will ultimately become the norm, starting with private enterprise solutions and the SMB markets through the likes of Zoom. Through Voice over 5G (Vo5G), there will also be support for Ultra High Definition (UHD) audio communications, streaming video, and ultra-clear voice communication for next-generation virtual reality applications and services. Vo5G will benefit VR for consumer and enterprise applications in many respects such as UHD becoming the norm in immersive experiences.

Time\\nSpeak directly to the analyst to clarify any post sales queries you may have.\\nThis report evaluates VR applications for the consumer and enterprise sectors for which we see gaming, education, and simulations training leading the way. The report assesses leading companies, strategies, products, and services. It provides analysis and forecasts for VR gaming, education, and simulations for 2021 through 2026.\\nSelect Report Findings:\\n* 5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming\\n* For training and instruction, we see everything from situational to more traditional expectations such as VR enhanced simulations for flight and vehicle training\\n* VR solution-focused offerings will focus upon very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training\\n* Edge computing will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases\\nWe see fully immersive virtual reality systems gaining substantial market momentum in consumer markets within the next few years. These VR systems will provide an unprecedented digital experience for humans, often including multiple senses as well as interaction with virtual objects and/or interaction between the real and virtual worlds.\\nIn terms of the consumer segment, we see current VR gaming evolving from current offerings such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PlayStation VR to more sophisticated entertainment that involves elements of casual gaming combined with real-world interests involving the economy and social status.\\nIn many respects, VR gaming is a greenfield opportunity, which will bring many new market entrants into the fray as application and content providers aggressively compete to establish a loyal user base. For example, Skydance Interactive, a division of Skydance Media, has recently unveiled The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, initially available on Oculus Rift, Rift S, Quest, and HTC Vive.\\nSuccessful companies will be those that develop communities of interest based on game-play and follower dynamics including innovation in interactive e-sports entertainment, in-game reward systems, and real-world to VR gamification integration. Long-term success will be dependent upon game delivery platform, system, and connectivity independence. This will occur coincident with a few key trends in platform/network transformation and service delivery such as the shift from console to cloud supported platforms and 5G communications supported by edge computing.\\nSome very compelling enterprise VR applications are anticipated to emerge over the next three to five years. Many of these will be solution-focused upon achieving very specific internal business goals such as risk mitigation, expense reduction, and employee training. Enterprise applications will extend beyond internal use and B2B as businesses embrace the use of VR to reach consumer markets. Real estate is a prime example where VR may be used for education-sales such as training new home buyers while simultaneously marketing properties.\\nWe see the virtual reality market gaining ground once 5G is more firmly in place commercially, but not entirely due to wireless VR. Instead, we see a massive build-out of broadband as a whole (due to competition from the 5G market) as one of the fundamental drivers for VR adoption. This will be driven in part by substantially greater availability of FTTX and HFC as well as greater bandwidth overall at lower costs.\\n5G will act as a launchpad for enhanced consumer wireless services such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and cloud gaming. Previously encumbered by a combination of technology gaps and consumer readiness issues, the virtual reality market is poised for substantive global growth, providing abundant opportunities for service providers, content developers, and ecosystem component providers.\\nWhile today many apps and services within the XR universe are very device-dependent and network constrained, convergence is on the horizon from a device perspective as well as substantial opportunities through untethering via 5G and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). MEC will be particularly important in support of latency-sensitive apps and services for various consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases. This will be particularly the case for VR portability, and to some extent, mobility to the extent that there is good 5G coverage.\\nSubstantially lower latency facilitated by the combination of 5G and MEC will lead to many new and enhanced applications. For example, VR-based telepresence will ultimately become the norm, starting with private enterprise solutions and the SMB markets through the likes of Zoom.\\nThrough Voice over 5G (Vo5G), there will also be support for Ultra High Definition (UHD) audio communications, streaming video, and ultra-clear voice communication for next-generation virtual reality applications and services. Vo5G will benefit VR for consumer and enterprise applications in many respects such as UHD becoming the norm in immersive experiences.\\nTarget Audience:\\n* Virtual reality companies\\n* Electronics manufacturers\\n* Network service providers\\n* Regulatory and policy groups\\n* Artificial intelligence providers\\n* Application and content providers\\nReport Benefits:\\n* Analysis and forecasts for VR in gaming, education, and simulations\\n* Understand the VR ecosystem including equipment, platforms, and services\\n* Identify the leading VR vendors, strategies, products, applications, and services\\n* Understand the VR market drivers including economics, adoption, and usage factors\\nWith the purchase of this report at the Multi-user License or greater level, you will have access to one hour with an expert analyst who will help you link key findings in the report to the business issues you're addressing.
