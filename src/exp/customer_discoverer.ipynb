If the query uses special operators that you entered either directly or indirectly through the advanced search form, they will appear in the search box as well.

In the examples below, click on the similar ways of specifying various searches and note how the results differ.\\nFor simplicity sake, this tutorial uses square brackets to denote Google’s search box. For example, to search for a cheap hotel in Mykonos, I’ll put the words “cheap,” “hotel,” and “Mykonos” in square brackets, [ cheap hotel Mykonos ], to indicate you should type those three words in Google’s search box. You should not type the brackets, although Google will ignore them if you do type them.\\nFurthermore, in the examples that follow, each set of search terms is linked to the results of a Google search on those terms. So clicking on [ cheap Mykonos hotel ] returns the Google results page for a search on those three words.\\n  1. Use Likely Words\\n Use words likely to appear on the pages you want. \\n[ salary negotiation tips ]\\n[ sciatica ]\\n[ window treatments ]\\nAvoid using a question as a query. For example, the query, [ Does Australia have Target ], instructs Google to find pages containing all the terms. Such a query won’t necessarily find pages answering your question. A better query might be [ Australia Target store ].\\nUSE [ Australia Target store ]\\nNOT [ Does Australia have Target ]\\nWhen Google detects very common words such as where, do, I, for, and a, known as  stop words , it ignores them so Google may return relevant results. If you’re seeking pages that include a stop word, e.g., “how the west was won,” learn how to force Google to search for a complete phrase or a specific word in  Crafting Your Query  and the following pages.\\nAvoid using words that you might associate with your topic, but you wouldn’t expect to find on the designated page(s). For example, queries that include “articles about,” “discussion of,” “documentation on,” and “pages about” are likely to return fewer results since information on the web is rarely labeled with such terms.\\nUSE [ lasik eye surgery ]\\nNOT [ documentation on lasik eye surgery ]\\nUSE [ jobs product marketing Sunnyvale ]\\nNOT [ listings of product marketing jobs in Sunnyvale ]\\nSuppose you want to know how old someone is, such as Nelson Mandela (the former President of South Africa). Pages with “birthday” or “age” might be more than a year old. Searching for pages that include “Nelson Mandela” and “born” are likely to include either “Nelson Mandela born” or “Nelson Mandela was born” followed by his birth date. You can figure out his age from knowing when he was born (to do the math, try the Google Calculator).\\nUSE [ Nelson Mandela born ]\\nNOT [ Nelson Mandela birthday ] nor [ Nelson Mandela age ]\\nNot sure what word or phrase is likely to appear on pages you want? Consider running a word or phrase popularity contest with Google Fight, which you can find at www.googlefight.com. This third-party application reports which of two terms or phrases Google estimates to be more prevalent on the web (actually on more web pages that Google has included in its index).\\n \\nGoogle Fight found 48,900,000 uses of “screen shot” but only 3,620,000 uses of “screenshot”. (In 2004, using a previous version of Google Fight named Google Smackdown, “screenshot” was more popular than “screen shot”.)\\n Note: How Google Works describes how Google finds web pages and constructs an index.\\n  2. Be Specific\\n Be specific: Use more query terms to narrow your results. \\nIt’s better to use a more precise, less ambiguous term than a common one to “flesh out the topic by including facets that interest you,” notes Ned Fielden in his book Internet Research, Second Edition (McFarland &amp; Company, 2001).\\nDoes your query have enough specific information for Google to determine unambiguously what you’re seeking? If your query is too vague, it’s unlikely to return relevant results. Consider, for example, the query [ java ]. What do you suppose Google includes in the first page of results? An island in Indonesia? A beverage consisting of an infusion of ground coffee beans? A computer network-oriented platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems?\\nUSE [ Java Indonesia ], [ java coffee ], or [ java programming language ]\\nNOT [ java ]\\nHow can you come up with more specific search terms? What do you know about the topic? Consider answers to the questions, “who?”, “what?”, “where?”, “when?”, “why?”, and “how?”\\nWhen you search for [ Tom Watson ], on the first page of results you may get references to a member of Parliament, the golfer, the IBM executive, and a Populist Party candidate for President in 1900 and 1904. If you’re searching for something that could return many different types of results, you should add a term that distinguishes among them. This way you’ll get only results about the specific Tom Watson you’re interested in.\\nUSE [ Tom Watson MP ], [ Tom Watson golf ], or [ Tom Watson IBM ]\\nNOT [ Tom Watson ]\\nUSE [ baby development ] or [ baby milestones ]\\nNOT [ babies ]\\nUSE [ Betty Ford Center drug addiction ]\\nNOT [ Ford Center ]\\n Note: Google limits queries to 32 words.\\n  3. Brevity\\nFor best results, use a few precise words. For example, a program on quitting smoking is more likely to include the terms “quit smoking program” than the words “program on quitting tobacco cigarette smoking addiction.”\\nUSE [ quit smoking program ]\\nNOT [ program on quitting tobacco cigarette smoking addiction ]\\n  4. Spelling\\n You don’t have to correct your spelling. \\nThere’s a good chance that Google will recognize your mistakes and suggest an alternative more common spelling, usually faster than you can look up the term in an online dictionary.\\nWhen you enter: [ Anna Kornikova tennis ]\\nGoogle responds: Did you mean: Anna Kournikova tennis \\n Note: Before clicking on Google’s suggested spelling, consider whether it’s what you want. Spelling checkers, like people, make mistakes.\\nFor more information on Google’s spelling correction system, see Spelling Suggestions.\\n Note: Even if you use the search tips described in Google Guide, you won’t be able to access authoritative information that’s available offline, e.g., old reference books, or is stored in specialized databases. For such information is not currently searchable with Google.\\nNext we’ll look at how Google interprets your query.\\nFor more information on the basics of Google search, visit How to search on Google.\\n Exercises \\nThese problems give you experience in selecting search terms. For hints and answers to selected problems, see the Solutions page.\\n  Find a page with “Google doodle.”\\nFind the Dilbert cartoon that Scott Adams developed by using Google’s logo.\\nWhat’s Google’s history?\\nFind contact information for your representative(s), e.g., senator, congresswoman (or congressman), or member of Parliament.\\nHow long did it take the first person to cross the United States by car and in what year was it first done?\\nIn the summer of 1997, an email message was widely circulated featuring the text of a “commencement speech” purportedly given by Kurt Vonnegut at MIT. The imaginary speech began “Wear sunscreen.” What’s the story behind this email hoax? What did this funny well-written fantasy “commencement speech” say?\\nLearn about the recommended tours of the Hearst Castle.\\nFind a recipe for lamb with mint sauce.\\n tags (keywords):  brackets, narrowing search, queries, search terms, spelling, stop words \\nWhen you don’t find what you’re seeking, consider specifying more precisely what you want by using Google’s Advanced Search feature. Don’t be frightened by the name “Advanced Search”; it’s easy to use, and it allows you to select or exclude pages with more precision than Google’s standard search box. Click on the Advanced Search link at the right of Google’s search box.\\n \\nor visit www.google.com/advanced_search and fill in the form. (If you previously entered a query from the standard search box, then clicked on the Advanced Search link at the top of the results page, the Advanced Search form is automatically filled in with appropriate information from your previous query.)\\nThe top of the Advanced Search form is where you’ll specify most of your search requirements. Clicking on the link “Date, usage rights, numeric range, and more,” or the + sign next to it, shows even more choices (which we’ll see in later sections). At the bottom of the search form are links to some of Google’s topic-specific searches, including special searches for various computer operating systems and universities. \\nThe box at the top of the form, which first contains the gray text “Use the form below and your advanced search will appear here,” shows the Google query that’s generated by your advanced search — including special characters and advanced operators, if any. This is a great way to become familiar with those advanced Google features.\\n Note: This feature may not work on older browsers or if you’ve set a “high-security” mode — including disabling JavaScript in your browser.\\nAdvanced Search field\\nBasic Search Example\\nBasic Search results\\n all these words\\n[ tap dance ]\\nwith all search terms\\n this exact wording or phrase\\n[  “tap dance“  ]\\nonly with the exact phrase inside the quotes\\n one or more of these words\\n[ tap OR ballet ]\\n with at least one of the terms adjacent to OR \\n any of these unwanted words\\n[ tap –dance ] [  –tap dance ]\\nincluding none of the terms preceded by a – \\nLet’s look at some examples. If you click on the screen shots in this section, you’ll be taken to the results of running the corresponding search.\\nThe second part of the Advanced Search page lets you omit pages containing certain words.\\n   \\nThe next part of the Advanced Search page, Need more tools?, gives more control over the pages listed in your search results.\\n \\nNow we’ll look at the rest of the form — including the section that opens after you click on “Date, usage rights, numeric range, and more” or the + next to it. If you want to jump ahead to a particular part, though, choose it from this list:\\n Results per page \\n Language \\n File Format \\n Domain \\n Date \\n Usage Rights \\n Occurrences \\n Region \\n Numeric Range \\n SafeSearch \\n Similar Pages \\n Linking Pages \\n  1. Results per page\\nTo see more than ten search results at once, choose how many with the drop-down Results per page: box. The results page will take longer to load — though you may only notice the difference if you’re using a slow Internet connection. To see 50 results per page:\\n \\n(Choosing the number of results doesn’t affect what you’ll see in the box “your advanced search will appear here” at the top of the form. However, after performing the search, the URL at the top of your browser window should include the text &amp;num=50; it specifies 50 results per page.)\\n  2. Language\\nThe drop-down Language: box can resrict results to pages written in a specific language. For example, find pages in Spanish with recommendations for hotels in Andalucía, Spain. Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\n(Choosing the language doesn’t change what you’ll see in the box at the top of the form. After performing the search, though, the URL at the top of your browser window should include the text &amp;lr=lang_es; it specifies Spanish.)\\nIf you always want only results in a certain language or set of languages, then change your search language in your Google preferences. See Customizing Your Preferences to learn how to change your Google preferences to modify the way your search results appear.\\n  3. File Format\\nIn the File Format area, you restrict your results to a particular file format, or exclude a format from your results. Choices include:\\nFile Format\\nSuffix\\nDescription\\nAdobe Acrobat PDF\\n.pdf\\nA publishing format commonly used for product manuals and documents of all sorts.\\nAdobe PostScript\\n.ps\\nA printing format often used for academic papers.\\nMicrosoft Word\\n.doc\\nA common word processing format.\\nMicrosoft Excel\\n.xls\\nA format for spreadsheets.\\nMicrosoft Powerpoint\\n.ppt\\nA format for presentations and slides.\\nRich Text Format\\n.rtf\\nA format used to exchange documents between Microsoft Word and other formats.\\nSince documents in PDF format tend to be better written than web pages, let’s search for documents on estate planning in PDF format. Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\nYou can restrict your search to other file formats by using the  filetype: search operator.\\n  4. Domain\\nTo search only a specific website (e.g., www.eff.org) or domain (e.g., .org) or exclude that site or domain completely from your search, use the field Search within a site or domain:. In another page, we’ll see how to find the website or domain for a web page if you know its address.\\nLet’s look at a couple of examples. If you click on the screen shots in this section, you’ll be taken to the Advanced Search form specifying the corresponding search.\\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s founders, were graduate students at Stanford when they wrote a paper describing their prototype search engine. Let’s search for it by entering their names and restricting our search domain to Stanford University’s site, stanford.edu. Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\nTo find information on volunteering for an organization, search for results with the word “volunteering” and restrict the domain to “.org”. Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\n  5. Date\\nHere you can restrict results to pages that have been updated (created or modified), crawled, and added to Google’s index (indexed) in the past three, six, or twelve months. Popular pages that are updated often are crawled and indexed frequently.\\n Note: Any change in the page counts as an update, even a spelling correction.\\nThis option is useful when searching for timely information such as annual events, specifications for a new model of car or appliance, or what people have been doing lately.\\nRecently, scientists reported new findings about the risks and benefits of hormone therapy used by 40% of postmenopausal American women to relieve menopause symptoms. We’re more likely to find links to this information by searching only for web pages updated in the last three months. Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\n(Choosing the date range doesn’t affect what you’ll see in the box “your advanced search will appear here” at the top of the form. However, after performing the search, the URL at the top of your browser window should include the text &amp;as_qdr=m3; it specifies 3 months.)\\nVisit the Wayback Machine if you want to see what a site looked like months or years ago or if a site is currently inaccessible. The Wayback Machine, also known as the Internet Archive, maintains a digital library of snapshots of many Internet sites.\\n  6. Usage Rights\\nFor pages covered by the Creative Commons license, Usage Rights: lets you specify what types of usage the page should allow.\\nIn general — unless a page states otherwise — it’s safe to assume that pages you find with Google cannot be freely used in any way you like. However, some pages have special marking to tell search engines such as Google that the page is covered by the Creative Commons license — and what types of usage are permitted. The Usage Rights search finds these specially-marked pages.\\nYour choices are:\\nUsage Rights\\nDescription\\nnot filtered by license\\nstandard, unfiltered Google results\\nfree to use or share\\nresults you can copy or redistribute\\nfree to use or share, even commercially\\nresults you can copy or redistribute for profit\\nfree to use share or modify\\nresults you can copy or adapt, as well as redistribute\\nfree to use, share or modify, even commercially\\nresults you can copy or adapt, as well as redistribute, for profit\\nNote that simply finding pages with the Usage Rights search doesn’t guarantee your rights. You should check each page to be sure about its usage terms.\\nLet’s say that you want to build a website with recipes for vegetables. We’ll find pages on Google with Usage Rights “free to use, share or modify, even commercially”\\n   \\n(Specifying usage rights doesn’t change what you’ll see in the box at the top of the form. Setting this drop-down box makes a change in your browser’s URL that can be complicated. If you’re curious, experiment with various settings and check the URL you get after clicking the Advanced Search button.)\\n  7. Occurrences\\nThe field labeled Where your keywords show up: lets you specify where your search terms must occur on the page. Choices are anywhere on the page, in the title, in the text, in the URL, or in links to the page.\\nThe  title  of a webpage is usually displayed at the top of the browser window and in the first line of Google’s search results for a page. The author of a website specifies the title of a page with the HTML &lt;TITLE&gt; element. There’s only one title in a webpage.\\n The Uniform Resource Locator, more commonly known as URL, is the address that specifies the location of a file on the Internet.\\nThe  link  is the text on a page that is linked to another web page or a different place on the current page. When you click on the link, you will be taken to the page or place on the page to which it is linked.\\nFind pages on Google whose URL contains FAQ, an abbreviation for either Frequently Asked Questions or Frequently Answered Question. In the solution below I look for pages containing both Google and FAQ in the URL. Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\n  8. Region\\nHere you can request pages from a particular country or region of the world. (The results may show URLs from that part of the world, or they may end in more common domains like “.com”. In the latter case, the page may be from a regional version of a multinational website.)\\nTo read pages from South Africa about President Clinton or Senator Clinton, click on the image to perform the search:\\n   \\n(Choosing the region doesn’t change the search shown in the box at the top of the form. After you search, though, the URL at the top of your browser window should include the text &amp;cr=countryZA; ZA is the code for South Africa — and its Internet domain.)\\n  9. Numeric Range\\nUse Numeric Range: when you want pages containing numbers in a specified range.\\nWhen I was interested in a “half-bicycle” trailer for my young twins, I searched for one called Trail-a-Bike in the price range $50-$1000. Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\n(In this case, I could also have used Google’s Product Search.)\\n  10. SafeSearch\\nThe SafeSearch: area allows you to filter out sites that contain pornography or explicit sexual content and eliminate them from search results. Be aware that Google’s automated filtering doesn’t guarantee that you won’t be shown offensive content.\\nWhen you turn off SafeSearch filtering and search for non-pornographic content, Google will order your results in a way that adult sites won’t be listed prominently. For example, searching for [ breast cancer treatment ] with SafeSearch turned off, you’re unlikely to run across sites with provocative images of breasts.\\n   \\nIn an effort to return as many useful results as possible, SafeSearch doesn’t currently filter out hate speech, anarchy, criminal activity, crude and tasteless material, illegal weapons, bomb making, etc., content that other filtering systems attempt to exclude.\\n  11. Page-Specific Searches\\nThe “Page-specific tools:” search boxes are no longer part of the Advanced Search form.Use the search operators listed below — related: and link:.\\nThe Advanced Search form also offers page-specific searches for finding pages similar to a page for which you have a web address (URL) and for finding out what pages link to a particular page.\\n  To find pages similar to Consumer Reports’ web page, fill in the first page-specific search box, Find pages similar to the page:. Then click on the associated Search button. For a description of how Google determines when pages are similar, see How does Google find similar pages?.\\n \\n(The page-specific searches are separate from the rest of the Advanced Search form, so they don’t change the box at the top of the form with the gray text “Use the form below and your advanced search will appear here.” After you search, though, the Google Search box near the top of the results page should begin with the search operator related: — in this example, related:www.consumerreports.org.) \\n  Web pages link from one to another. Links are unidirectional; you can follow links from one page to another. You cannot traverse the link the other way around, i.e., go from a page to the pages that link to it. However, Google keeps track of this information and makes it available. When you want to know who links to your website or to someone else’s, fill in a web address (URL) in the page-specific search section Find pages that link to the page:. Let’s find who links to the Doctors without Borders, aka  Médecins Sans Frontières  (MSF), website www.doctorswithoutborders.org.\\n   \\n(As for the similar-page search, you won’t see link-search terms in the box at the top of the Advanced Search page. However, the Google Search box near the top of the results page should begin with the search operator link: — in this example, link:www.doctorswithoutborders.org.)\\nThe most common users of backward links are webmasters and website publishers who are curious to know what sites link to theirs. People also use them to find out who links to competitors’ sites. \\nUnlike the other fields in the Advanced Search form, the page-specific searches can’t be combined with other query terms. Consequently each has its own Search button.\\nYou can easily run these page-specific searches from Google’s Toolbar.\\n   Instead of going to the Advanced Search form, you can search for a web site by entering its address in the search box and Google returns a link to the website, as well as links to:\\nGoogle’s cache of the site\\nWeb pages that are similar to the site\\nWeb pages that link to the site\\nAll Web pages from the site that Google has crawled, listed in PageRank order\\nWeb pages that contain the URL\\nFor example, to find out about the wonderful reference site www.refdesk.com, enter  www.refdesk.com  into Google’s search box.\\n \\n tags (keywords):  advanced search, creative commons license, date, domain, file format, language, narrowing search, numbers, phrase, queries, safe search, search terms, URLs \\nYou can narrow results for complex searches with Advanced Search. For example, you can find sites in German that were updated in the last 24 hours or clip art images in black and white.\\n Tip: In the Google search box, you can use Advanced Search filters with search operators like quotes, minus signs, and site:.

By focusing on certain keywords and excluding others, they allow you to use Google more accurately and effectively. In this article, we list some basic and advanced Google Search operators with tips on how to use them.  Related: The Complete Guide To Researching a Company  What are Google search operators? Google Search operators are combinations of words and symbols that improve your online search results. By focusing on certain keywords and excluding others, they allow you to use Google more accurately and effectively. Search operators can include:    Words such as AND or OR   Punctuation such as quotation marks   Symbols such as @ or $   Any combination of these   Professionals who are responsible for search engine optimization (SEO) in their jobs use these commands frequently and likely know many advanced search operators.  12 Basic search operators These 12 basic search operators are the ones people use most frequently, particularly when doing research. \" \" Surround your search term with quotation marks to get an exact match of that word or phrase.Example: \"B2B marketing jobs\" *The asterisk, known as a wildcard, searches for any word or phrase you include.Example: terriers * labradors OR Place OR (all caps) between two words to combine searches. Use it to search for results that have one of those words but not both.Example: B2B OR B2C AND Place AND (all caps) between two words if you want your results to include both.Example: B2B AND B2C | The pipe symbol does the same thing as OR.Example: B2B | B2C ( ) Put a search term between parenthesis to group commands.Example: (B2B OR B2C) marketing jobs - Put a hyphen before any term you want to exclude from results.Example: dog breeds -terriers .. If you want to search for a number between a range of numbers, place two periods between that range. Example: election results 1996..2016 $ Use a dollar sign to search for prices. You can use the Euro sign to search for prices in that currency. Example: piano $1500 @ Use this symbol to search for results in social media.Example: @twitter # Use this symbol to search for hashtags.Example: #sundayfunday in Put \"in\" between two units you want to convert.Example: 100 F in C Related: How To Use Google Alerts During Your Job Search  15 advanced search operators Advanced search operators are commands that usually need additional information (such as a website or a related term) to work. They help filter search results more than basic operators. They include: site: Search within a certain website or web domain.Example: site:indeed.com or site:.edu related: Find websites with content similar to a certain website.Example: related:indeed.com cache: Find Google\\'s most recent cached (saved) version of a webpage.Example: cache:indeed.com filetype: Search for only one type of file.Example: filetype:PDF define: Find the definition of a word.Example: define:neuroscience weather: Find the weather for a location by city, state, county or ZIP code.Example: weather:77354 stocks: Get information about a stock, including its price and recent trends.Example: stocks:TSLA map: See a map of a location.Example: map:houston AROUND(X) Search for terms within a certain number of words of each other.Example: marketing AROUND(5) B2B intext: Search for words within a webpage\\'s body text.Example: intext:B2B allintext: Search a page for every term after the command. Add \"all\" before any of the following search operators (allinurl, allintitle, allinposttitle, allinanchor) to search for all terms.Example: allintext:B2B marketing jobs inurl: Find a URL with a certain word or phrase.Example: dog breeds inurl:terrier intitle: Search a page title for a word or phrase.Example: intitle:backsplash inposttitle: Search for a term within a blog post title.Example: inposttitle:DIY backsplash inanchor: Search for sites linked with specific anchor text.Example: inanchor:backsplash Related: Guide: What Is SEO?

Here are six tips for using them effectively: Remove spaces between commands and search terms. A clean search will likely give you the best results. Combine search operators. You can use nearly all basic and advanced commands together to narrow your search further.Example: \"marketing jobs\" site:indeed.com inurl:B2B Exclude terms that are not valuable to your search. Use a hyphen frequently to avoid content that is not helpful.Example: \"marketing jobs\" -houston -freelance Find plagiarism. Find out if someone has copied your content by searching for a phrase and excluding your site.Example: intext:\"SEO is the process of attracting organic traffic to your website\" -site:indeed.com Learn how Google categorizes your site. Use the related: command to find competing sites and how they rank on search results. Find pages on your website that are not secure. Website URLs that start with HTTPS are secure, while URLs that start with HTTP aren\\'t secure. Search your site for unsecured pages using this command: site:indeed.com -inurl:https. How to use Google Search operators You can use Google Search operators to find information the same way you would search for any topic or keyword:   Think of a topic you want to research.   Decide if you want to narrow your search by excluding certain results or looking for information from one particular website.   Find a search operator to perform your specific search. 4.

How can we improve it? \\nThe following table lists the search operators that work with each Google search service. Click on an operator to jump to its description — or, to read about all of the operators, simply scroll down and read all of this page. The following is an alphabetical list of the search operators. This list includes operators that are not officially supported by Google and not listed in Google\\'s brief online help Refine web searches. Each entry typically includes the syntax, the capabilities, and an example. Some of the search operators won’t work as intended if you put a space between the colon (:) and the subsequent query word. If you don’t care to check which search operators require no space after the colon, always place the keyword immediately next to the colon. Many search operators can appear anywhere in your query. In our examples, we place the search operator as far to the right as possible. We do this because the Advanced Search form writes queries in this way. Also, such a convention makes it clearer as to which operators are associated with which terms. \\n   allinanchor: \\nIf you start your query with allinanchor:, Google restricts results to pages containing all query terms you specify in the anchor text on links to the page. For example, [ allinanchor: best museums sydney ] will return only pages in which the anchor text on links to the pages contain the words “best,” “museums,” and “sydney.”\\n  Anchor text is the text on a page that is linked to another web page or a different place on the current page. When you click on anchor text, you will be taken to the page or place on the page to which it is linked. When using allinanchor: in your query, do not include any other search operators. The functionality of allinanchor: is also available through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\n   allintext: \\nIf you start your query with allintext:, Google restricts results to those containing all the query terms you specify in the text of the page. For example, [ allintext: travel packing list ] will return only pages in which the words “travel,” “packing,” and “list” appear in the text of the page. This functionality can also be obtained through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\n   allintitle: \\nIf you start your query with allintitle:, Google restricts results to those containing all the query terms you specify in the title. For example, [ allintitle: detect plagiarism ] will return only documents that contain the words “detect” and “plagiarism” in the title. This functionality can also be obtained through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\nThe  title  of a webpage is usually displayed at the top of the browser window and in the first line of Google’s search results for a page. The author of a website specifies the title of a page with the HTML TITLE element. There’s only one title in a webpage. When using allintitle: in your query, do not include any other search operators. The functionality of allintitle: is also available through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\nIn Image Search, the operator allintitle: will return images in files whose names contain the terms that you specify.\\nIn Google News, the operator allintitle: will return articles whose titles include the terms you specify.\\n   allinurl: \\nIf you start your query with allinurl:, Google restricts results to those containing all the query terms you specify in the URL. For example, [ allinurl: google faq ] will return only documents that contain the words “google” and “faq” in the URL, such as “www.google.com/help/faq.html”. This functionality can also be obtained through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\nIn URLs, words are often run together. They need not be run together when you’re using allinurl:.\\nIn Google News, the operator allinurl: will return articles whose titles include the terms you specify.\\n The Uniform Resource Locator, more commonly known as URL, is the address that specifies the location of a file on the Internet. When using allinurl: in your query, do not include any other search operators. The functionality of allinurl: is also available through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\n   author: \\nIf you include author: in your query, Google will restrict your Google Groups results to include newsgroup articles by the author you specify. The author can be a full or partial name or email address. For example, [ children author:john author:doe ] or [ children author:doe@someaddress.com ] return articles that contain the word “children” written by John Doe or doe@someaddress.com.\\nGoogle will search for exactly what you specify. If your query contains [ author:”John Doe” ] (with quotes), Google won’t find articles where the author is specified as “Doe, John.”\\n   cache: \\nThe query cache:url  will display Google’s cached version of a web page, instead of the current version of the page. For example, [ cache:www.eff.org ] will show Google’s cached version of the Electronic Frontier Foundation home page.\\n Note: Do not put a space between cache: and the URL (web address).\\nOn the cached version of a page, Google will highlight terms in your query that appear after the cache: search operator. For example, [ cache:www.pandemonia.com/flying/ fly diary ] will show Google’s cached version of Flight Diary in which Hamish Reid’s documents what’s involved in learning how to fly with the terms “fly” and “diary” highlighted.\\n   define: \\nIf you start your query with define:, Google shows definitions from pages on the web for the term that follows. This advanced search operator is useful for finding definitions of words, phrases, and acronyms. For example, [ define: blog ] will show definitions for “Blog” (weB LOG).\\n   ext: \\nThis is an undocumented alias for filetype:.\\n   filetype: \\nIf you include filetype:suffix  in your query, Google will restrict the results to pages whose names end in  suffix . For example, [ web page evaluation checklist filetype:pdf ] will return Adobe Acrobat pdf files that match the terms “web,” “page,” “evaluation,” and “checklist.” You can restrict the results to pages whose names end with pdf and doc by using the OR operator, e.g. [ email security filetype:pdf OR filetype:doc ].\\n   When you don’t specify a File Format in the Advanced Search Form or the filetype: operator, Google searches a variety of file formats; see the table in File Type Conversion.\\n   group: \\nIf you include group: in your query, Google will restrict your Google Groups results to newsgroup articles from certain groups or subareas. For example, [ sleep group:misc.kids.moderated ] will return articles in the group misc.kids.moderated that contain the word “sleep” and [ sleep group:misc.kids ] will return articles in the subarea misc.kids that contain the word “sleep.”\\n   id: \\nThis is an undocumented alias for info:.\\n   inanchor: \\nIf you include inanchor: in your query, Google will restrict the results to pages containing the query terms you specify in the anchor text or links to the page. For example, [ restaurants inanchor:gourmet ] will return pages in which the anchor text on links to the pages contain the word “gourmet” and the page contains the word “restaurants.”\\n   info: \\nThe query info: URL   will present some information about the corresponding web page. For instance, [ info:gothotel.com ] will show information about the national hotel directory GotHotel.com home page.\\n Note: There must be no space between the info: and the web page URL.\\nThis functionality can also be obtained by typing the web page URL directly into a Google search box.\\n   insubject: \\nIf you include insubject: in your query, Google will restrict articles in Google Groups to those that contain the terms you specify in the subject. For example, [ insubject:”falling asleep” ] will return Google Group articles that contain the phrase “falling asleep” in the subject.\\nEquivalent to intitle:.\\n   intext: \\nThe query intext:term  restricts results to documents containing  term  in the text. For instance, [ Hamish Reid intext:pandemonia ] will return documents that mention the word “pandemonia” in the text, and mention the names “Hamish” and “Reid” anywhere in the document (text or not).\\n Note: There must be no space between the intext: and the following word.\\nPutting intext: in front of every word in your query is equivalent to putting allintext: at the front of your query, e.g., [ intext:handsome intext:poets ] is the same as [ allintext: handsome poets ].\\n   intitle: \\nThe query intitle:term  restricts results to documents containing  term  in the title. For instance, [ flu shot intitle:help ] will return documents that mention the word “help” in their titles, and mention the words “flu” and “shot” anywhere in the document (title or not).\\n Note: There must be no space between the intitle: and the following word.\\nPutting intitle: in front of every word in your query is equivalent to putting allintitle: at the front of your query, e.g., [ intitle:google intitle:search ] is the same as [ allintitle: google search ].\\n   inurl: \\nIf you include inurl: in your query, Google will restrict the results to documents containing that word in the URL. For instance, [ inurl:print site:www.googleguide.com ] searches for pages on Google Guide in which the URL contains the word “print.” It finds pdf files that are in the directory or folder named “print” on the Google Guide website. The query [ inurl:healthy eating ] will return documents that mention the words “healthy” in their URL, and mention the word “eating” anywhere in the document.\\n Note: There must be no space between the inurl: and the following word.\\nPutting inurl: in front of every word in your query is equivalent to putting allinurl: at the front of your query, e.g., [ inurl:healthy inurl:eating ] is the same as [ allinurl: healthy eating ].\\nIn URLs, words are often run together. They need not be run together when you’re using inurl:.\\n   link: \\nThe query link:URL  shows pages that point to that   URL  . For example, to find pages that point to Google Guide’s home page, enter:\\n[ link:www.googleguide.com ]\\n Note: According to Google’s documentation, “you cannot combine a link: search with a regular keyword search.”\\nAlso note that when you combine link: with another advanced operator, Google may not return all the pages that match. The following queries should return lots of results, as you can see if you remove the -site: term in each of these queries.\\nFind links to the Google home page not on Google’s own site.\\n[ link:www.google.com -site:google.com ]\\nFind links to the UK Owners Direct home page not on its own site.\\n[ link:www.www.ownersdirect.co.uk -site:ownersdirect.co.uk ]\\n   location: \\nIf you include location: in your query on Google News, only articles from the location you specify will be returned. For example, [ queen location:canada ] will show articles that match the term “queen” from sites in Canada. Many other country names work; try them and see.\\nTwo-letter US state abbreviations match individual US states, and two-letter Canadian province abbreviations (like NS for Nova Scotia) also work — although some provinces don’t have many newspapers online, so you may not get many results. Some other two-letter abbreviations — such as UK for the United Kingdom — are also available.\\n   movie: \\nIf you include movie: in your query, Google will find movie-related information. For examples, see Google’s Blog.\\n   related: \\nThe query related: URL   will list web pages that are similar to the web page you specify. For instance, [ related:www.consumerreports.org ] will list web pages that are similar to the Consumer Reports home page.\\n Note: Don’t include a space between the related: and the web page url.\\nYou can also find similar pages from the “Similar pages” link on Google’s main results page, and from the similar selector in the Page-Specific Search area of the Advanced Search page. If you expect to search frequently for similar pages, consider installing a GoogleScout browser button, which scouts for similar pages.\\n   site: \\nIf you include site: in your query, Google will restrict your search results to the site or domain you specify. For example, [ admissions site:www.lse.ac.uk ] will show admissions information from London School of Economics’ site and [ peace site:gov ] will find pages about peace within the .gov domain. You can specify a domain with or without a period, e.g., either as .gov or gov.\\n Note: Do not include a space between the “site:” and the domain.\\nYou can use many of the search operators in conjunction with the basic search operators +, –, OR, and \" \". For example, to find information on Windows security from all sites except microsoft.com, enter:\\n[ windows security –site:microsoft.com ]\\nYou can also restrict your results to a site or domain through the domains selector on the Advanced Search page.\\n   source: \\nIf you include source: in your query, Google News will restrict your search to articles from the news source with the ID you specify. For example, [ election source:new_york_times ] will return articles with the word “election” that appear in the New York Times.\\nTo find a news source ID, enter a query that includes a term and the name of the publication you’re seeking. You can also specify the publication name in the “news source” field in the Advanced News Search form. You’ll find the news source ID in the query box, following the source: search operator. For example, let’s say you enter the publication name Ha’aretz in the News Source box, then you click the Google Search button. The results page appears, and its search box contains [ peace source:ha_aretz__subscription_ ]. This means that the news source ID is ha_aretz__subscription_. This query will only return articles that include the word “peace” from the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz.\\n   weather \\nIf you enter a query with the word weather and a city or location name, if Google recognizes the location, the forecast will appear at the top of the results page. Otherwise, your results will usually include links to sites with the weather conditions and forecast for that location.\\nSince weather is not an advanced operator, there is no need to include a colon after the word. For example, [ weather Sunnyvale CA ] will return the weather for Sunnyvale, California and [ weather 94041 ] will return the weather for the city containing the zip code (US postal code) 94041, which is Mountain View, California.\\n The Google Guide Advanced Operator Quick Reference (www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators_reference.html) provides a nice summary of the search operators grouped by type. It includes search operators not yet documented by Google, e.g.,  allinanchor: ,  allintext: ,  author: ,  ext: ,  group: ,  id: ,  insubject: ,  intext: ,  intitle: ,  location: , and  source: . This problem set is designed to give you experiences with search operators and practice with specifying more precisely what you’re seeking by using the Advanced Search form. For hints and answers to selected problems, see the Solutions page. \\n15 minutes to complete \\nGoogle Trends: Improving your search results.\\nRefine your queries to get more useful data. \\nMoving beyond the basics.\\n Google Trends allows you to easily see the stories and subjects that are drawing attention. Exploring topics is a relatively simple process, and Trends includes some features and options to help refine your results. There are several ways to get the precise data you need to help prompt a story idea or support a point. \\nRefining your search using punctuation.\\n You can use punctuation to filter your Trends search results. For example, if you’re writing a story about alternative energy and search the term wind farm, with no punctuation, your results will contain both words in any order, along with other words (offshore wind farm, new methods to farm wind, wind saves the farm, etc.). No misspellings, spelling variations, synonyms, plural or singular versions of your terms will be included. \\nPunctuation guide.\\nHere’s how various punctuation can affect this search:\\nStep\\n1\\n“wind farm” – Double quotation marks around your term give results that include that exact term, possibly with words before and after (offshore wind farm, for example).\\nStep\\n2\\nwind + solar – Results can include the words wind OR solar.\\nStep\\n3\\nwind - farm – Results will include the word wind, but exclude the word farm. This is useful when searching a term that’s part of a popular phrase you want to keep from dominating your results.\\nStep\\n4\\nfueling + fuelling + fueleing – Results will include alternative spellings (fueling or fuelling) plus common misspellings (fueleing).\\nRefining your search by region.\\n When you search for a term in Google Trends, your results will include a map of the world showing areas where your term is popular. Darker shades indicate where your term has a higher probability of being searched. Simply hovering over a region will activate a pop-up window that reveals its search volume index. On the right of the map is a list view icon that displays the ranking of top regions or cities based on your term’s popularity. \\nNarrowing or expanding each search topic by geography and time.\\nOn the results page, you can refine your exploration by region and/or time period for each individual search topic.\\nStep\\n1\\nFor example, if you compare search interest in Wave power and Solar power, you’ll find that Solar power typically outpaces the Wave power for worldwide search interest.\\nStep\\n2\\nIf you want to examine local interest in different regions, hover over your search term and click the three dots. Then select Change filters from the menu.\\nStep\\n3\\nSpecify the region and time period you want to review.\\nStep\\n4\\nThe results may reveal a different relationship between the two search terms than what was shown in the worldwide comparison.\\nExploring U.S. metropolitan areas.\\nTrends even allows you to refine your geographical breakdown to the city level. Metros are geographical areas that generally correspond to U.S. metropolitan areas. Currently, Google Trends only provides metros for the United States. Let’s say you are continuing to research a story about energy and you want to look at geothermal energy search trends. You can get information for a specific metro area one of two ways: \\nStep\\n1\\nClick Worldwide at the top of your results page.\\nStep\\n2\\nChoose United States.\\nStep\\n3\\nTo examine the data for each metro area, click a specific state.\\nStep\\n4\\nTo view the map by city or metro area, use the Subregion menu above the map.\\nRefining your results using categories.\\nIf you\\'re using Trends to search for a word with multiple meanings, you can filter your results by category to get data for the version you’re looking for. \\nStep\\n1\\nSearch for your term, and on the results page, click All categories under the search box to reveal your category choices.\\nStep\\n2\\nChoose a category most closely related to the meaning you prefer.The results will reflect the number of searches for that term in that context.\\nUsing rising data.\\n  Rising shows terms that were searched for with the term you entered (or overall, if no search term was entered) which had the most significant growth in volume in the requested time period. For each rising search term, you’ll see a percentage of the term’s growth compared to the previous time period. If you see the term “Breakout,” it means that the search term did not exist in the previous time period, and we have no baseline. The percentages are based on the percent increase in search interest for the selected time frame.  Using geothermal energy as an example, if we\\'re looking at the last 7 days, the benchmark for the rise in searches for the term geothermal energy would be 7 days prior; if it was the last 30 days, the benchmark would be for the 30 days prior.

Google Trends: Improving your search results.\\n15 minutes to complete\\nGoogle Trends: Improving your search results.\\nRefine your queries to get more useful data.\\nGoogle Trends: Improving your search results.\\nMoving beyond the basics.\\nGoogle Trends allows you to easily see the stories and subjects that are drawing attention. Exploring topics is a relatively simple process, and Trends includes some features and options to help refine your results. There are several ways to get the precise data you need to help prompt a story idea or support a point.\\nMoving beyond the basics.\\nRefining your search using punctuation.\\nYou can use punctuation to filter your Trends search results.\\nFor example, if you’re writing a story about alternative energy and search the term wind farm, with no punctuation, your results will contain both words in any order, along with other words (offshore wind farm, new methods to farm wind, wind saves the farm, etc.). No misspellings, spelling variations, synonyms, plural or singular versions of your terms will be included.\\nRefining your search using punctuation.\\nPunctuation guide.\\nHere’s how various punctuation can affect this search:\\nStep 1\\n“wind farm” – Double quotation marks around your term give results that include that exact term, possibly with words before and after (offshore wind farm, for example).\\nStep 2\\nwind + solar – Results can include the words wind OR solar.\\nStep 3\\nwind - farm – Results will include the word wind, but exclude the word farm. This is useful when searching a term that’s part of a popular phrase you want to keep from dominating your results.\\nStep 4\\nfueling + fuelling + fueleing – Results will include alternative spellings (fueling or fuelling) plus common misspellings (fueleing).\\nPunctuation guide.\\nRefining your search by region.\\nWhen you search for a term in Google Trends, your results will include a map of the world showing areas where your term is popular. Darker shades indicate where your term has a higher probability of being searched.\\nSimply hovering over a region will activate a pop-up window that reveals its search volume index. On the right of the map is a list view icon that displays the ranking of top regions or cities based on your term’s popularity.\\nRefining your search by region.\\nNarrowing or expanding each search topic by geography and time.\\nOn the results page, you can refine your exploration by region and/or time period for each individual search topic.\\nStep 1\\nFor example, if you compare search interest in Wave power and Solar power, you’ll find that Solar power typically outpaces the Wave power for worldwide search interest.\\nStep 2\\nIf you want to examine local interest in different regions, hover over your search term and click the three dots. Then select Change filters from the menu.\\nStep 3\\nSpecify the region and time period you want to review.\\nStep 4\\nThe results may reveal a different relationship between the two search terms than what was shown in the worldwide comparison.\\nNarrowing or expanding each search topic by geography and time.\\nExploring U.S. metropolitan areas.\\nTrends even allows you to refine your geographical breakdown to the city level. Metros are geographical areas that generally correspond to U.S. metropolitan areas. Currently, Google Trends only provides metros for the United States. Let’s say you are continuing to research a story about energy and you want to look at geothermal energy search trends. You can get information for a specific metro area one of two ways:\\nStep 1\\nClick Worldwide at the top of your results page.\\nStep 2\\nChoose United States.\\nStep 3\\nTo examine the data for each metro area, click a specific state.\\nStep 4\\nTo view the map by city or metro area, use the Subregion menu above the map.\\nExploring U.S. metropolitan areas.\\nRefining your results using categories.\\nIf you\\'re using Trends to search for a word with multiple meanings, you can filter your results by category to get data for the version you’re looking for.\\nStep 1\\nSearch for your term, and on the results page, click All categories under the search box to reveal your category choices.\\nStep 2\\nChoose a category most closely related to the meaning you prefer.The results will reflect the number of searches for that term in that context.\\nRefining your results using categories.\\nUsing rising data.\\nRising shows terms that were searched for with the term you entered (or overall, if no search term was entered) which had the most significant growth in volume in the requested time period. For each rising search term, you’ll see a percentage of the term’s growth compared to the previous time period. If you see the term “Breakout,” it means that the search term did not exist in the previous time period, and we have no baseline.\\nThe percentages are based on the percent increase in search interest for the selected time frame.\\nUsing geothermal energy as an example, if we\\'re looking at the last 7 days, the benchmark for the rise in searches for the term geothermal energy would be 7 days prior; if it was the last 30 days, the benchmark would be for the 30 days prior.\\nThe only exception is when viewing the full history (2004-Present), when the percentages are benchmarked at 2004.\\nUsing rising data.\\nFinding related queries.\\nWhen you search for a term, the Related queries chart will appear at the bottom of your results page. Related queries can be used to determine the top and rising terms associated to any topic or trending story. This can be useful for finding unique angles on a story, for example.\\nStep 1\\nOn the chart, click the Rising tab and select Top.\\nStep 2\\nTop displays terms that are most frequently searched with the term you entered, in the same search session, with the same chosen category, country or region.\\nFinding related queries.\\nmake sure you have visited all the steps before moving forward\\nclose\\nSign up for the newsletter to get updates from the Google News Initative\\nGet the newsletter\\nPrivacy Policy Terms\\nhelp Help\\n* English (GB)\\n* English\\n* العربيّة\\n* বাংলা\\n* Français\\n* Deutsch\\n* עברית\\n* हिंदी\\n* Bahasa Indonesia\\n* Italiano\\n* 한국어\\n* 日本語\\n* Nederlands\\n* Polski\\n* Português brasileiro\\n* Español (LatAm)\\n* Español\\n* ภาษาไทย\\n* Türkçe\\n* 繁體中文\\n* Česky\\n* Tiếng việt \\nUltimate Guide to Google Search Operators and Parameters\\nAdvanced search operators can be entered directly into the Google search box to refine your search. Search parameters can be used to construct your own search strings by typing them into the address bar, also called the Chrome omnibar.\\nA search operator might look like: \\nallintitle: tesla vs edison\\n \\nA search parameter might look like:\\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=\"nikola+tesla\"\\n \\nWhat are Google search operators?\\nGoogle search operators are special characters and commands sometimes called “advanced operators” or search parameters that extend the capabilities of regular text searches. Search operators can be useful for everything from content research to technical SEO audits.\\nHow do I use search operators?\\nYou can enter search operators directly into the Google search box, just as you would a text search:\\n \\nExcept in special cases (such as the “in” operator), Google will return standard organic results.\\nGoogle search operators cheat sheet\\nYou can find all of the major organic search operators below, broken up into three categories: “Basic”, “Advanced”, and “Unreliable”. Basic search operators are operators that modify standard text searches.\\n   I. Basic search operators     \" \"   \"nikola tesla\"  Put any phrase in quotes to force Google to use exact-match. On single words, prevents synonyms.   OR   tesla OR edison  Google search defaults to logical AND between terms. Specify \"OR\" for a logical OR (ALL-CAPS).   |   tesla | edison  The pipe (|) operator is identical to \"OR\". Useful if your Caps-lock is broken :)   ( )   (tesla OR edison) alternating current  Use parentheses to group operators and control the order in which they execute.   -   tesla -motors  Put minus (-) in front of any term (including operators) to exclude that term from the results.   *   tesla \"rock * roll\"  An asterisk (*) acts as a wild-card and will match on any word.   #..#   tesla announcement 2015..2017  Use (..) with numbers on either side to match on any integer in that range of numbers.   $   tesla deposit $1000  Search prices with the dollar sign ($). You can combine ($) and (.) for exact prices, like $19.99.   €   €9,99 lunch deals  Search prices with the Euro sign (€). Most other currency signs don\\'t seem to be honored by Google.    in   250 kph in mph  Use \"in\" to convert between two equivalent units. This returns a special, Knowledge Card style result.   \\nAdvanced search operators are special commands that modify searches and may require additional parameters (such as a domain name). Advanced operators are typically used to narrow searches and drill deeper into results.\\n   II. Advanced search operators     intitle:   intitle:\"tesla vs edison\"  Search only in the page\\'s title for a word or phrase. Use exact-match (quotes) for phrases.   allintitle:   allintitle: tesla vs edison  Search the page title for every individual term following \"allintitle:\". Same as multiple intitle:\\'s.   inurl:   tesla announcements inurl:2016  Look for a word or phrase (in quotes) in the document URL. Can combine with other terms.   allinurl:   allinurl: amazon field-keywords nikon  Search the URL for every individual term following \"allinurl:\". Same as multiple inurl:\\'s.   intext:   intext:\"orbi vs eero vs google wifi\"  Search for a word or phrase (in quotes), but only in the body/document text.   allintext:   allintext: orbi eero google wifi  Search the body text for every individual term following \"allintext:\". Same as multiple intexts:\\'s.   filetype:   \"tesla announcements\" filetype:pdf  Match only a specific file type. Some examples include PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT, and TXT.   related:   related:nytimes.com  Return sites that are related to a target domain. Only works for larger domains.   AROUND(X)   tesla AROUND(3) edison  Returns results where the two terms/phrases are within (X) words of each other.   \\nUnreliable operators have either been found to produce inconsistent results or have been deprecated altogether. The \"link:\" operator was officially deprecated in early 2017. It appears that \"inanchor:\" operators are still in use, but return very narrow and sometimes unreliable results. Use link-based operators only for initial research.\\n   III. Unreliable/deprecated operators     ~   ~cars  Include synonyms. Seems to be unreliable, and synonym inclusion is default now.   +   +cars  Force exact-match on a single phrase. Deprecated with the launch of Google+.   daterange:   tesla announcements daterange:2457663-2457754  Return results in the specified range. Can be inconsistent. Requires Julian dates.   link:   link:nytimes.com  Find pages that link to the target domain. This operator was deprecated in early 2017.   inanchor:   inanchor:\"tesla announcements\"  Find pages linked to with the specified anchor text/phrase. Data is heavily sampled.   allinanchor:   allinanchor: tesla announcements  Find pages with all individual terms after \"inanchor:\" in the inbound anchor text.   \\nNote that, for all of the \"allin...:\" operators, Google will try to apply the operator to every term following it. Combining \"allin...:\" operators with any other operators will almost never produce the desired results.\\nSearch operator tips &amp; tricks\\nHaving all of the pieces is only the first step in building a puzzle. The real power of search operators comes from combining them.\\n1. Chain together operator combos\\nYou can chain together almost any combination of text searches, basic operators, and advanced operators:\\n\"nikola tesla\" intitle:\"top 5..10 facts\" -site:youtube.com inurl:2015\\nThis search returns any pages that mention \"Nikola Tesla\" (exact-match), have the phrase \"Top (X) facts\" in the title, where X ranges from 5 to 10, are not on YouTube.com, and have \"2015\" somewhere in the URL.\\n2. Hunt down plagiarized content\\nTrying to find out if your content is unique or if someone is plagiarizing you? Use a unique phrase from your text, put it in quotes (exact-match) after an \"intext:\" operator, and exclude your own site with \"-site:\"...\\nintext:\"they were frolicking in our entrails\" -site:moz.com\\nSimilarly, you can use \"intitle:\" with a long, exact-match phrase to find duplicate copies of your content.\\n3. Audit your HTTP-&gt;HTTPS transition\\nSwitching a site from HTTP to HTTPS can be challenging. Double-check your progress by seeing how many of each type of page Google has indexed. Use the \"site:\" operator on your root domain and then exclude HTTPS pages with \"-inurl:\"...\\nsite:moz.com -inurl:https\\nThis will help you track down any stragglers or find pages that might not have been re-crawled by Google.\\nThese are just a few examples of a nearly infinite set of combinations. Looking for more examples? You\\'re in luck! We\\'ve created a mega-list of 67 examples to catapult you toward site operator mastery.\\nRise in the rankings with Moz Pro\\nWith top-notch link and keyword data and in-depth analytics, Moz Pro provides the tracking and insights you need to reach #1.

This ultimate guide contains all of Google\\'s search string parameters. you can also build your own advanced search using google\\'s advanced search form.\\nhttp://www.google.com/search?\\nGoogle\\'s URL. You\\'ll see it if you look at the address bar, or Chrome omnibar.\\nq=query+goes+here\\nThe query string. Words are separated by + signs.\\nEverything from here on in is preceded by an &amp; sign, as it\\'s tagged on to the end. Here\\'s where things get interesting...\\n 1. Exact match query \\nas_epq=query+goes+here\\nResults must include the query, in the word order displayed.\\n Shows as \"query goes here\" \\n    2. Advanced \"Or\" filter  \\nas_oq=\"query+string\"+goes+here\\nResults must include one or more of the words in this string. \\nBasically, it\\'s like a more advanced version of the one above, using an \"or\" filter. Thus, every result must have the main initial query, and one or more of the sets of terms in these strings.\\n Shows as \"query string\" OR goes OR here     3. Negative Keywords  \\nas_eq=don\\'t+include+these+words\\nResults must NOT include any words in this string.\\n Shows as -don\\'t -include -these -words \\n 4. Limit the number of results  \\nnum=xx\\nControls the number of results shown. \\nMust be a numeric value, and can be anything up to 100. Doesn\\'t work with fractions.\\n 5. Filetype match \\nas_filetype=extension\\nOnly returns results that end in .extension. Currently supports any input. Try it - make a file with a random extension, get it indexed and do a search. Also shows that as long as it validates to something.\\n Shows as filetype:extension \\n 6. Limit results to one site  \\nas_sitesearch=example.com\\nLimits results to just the site you choose.\\n Shows as site:example.com \\n 7. Find results from specific dates   \\nas_qdr=x\\nSwap out x for the following to limit the search to only files first indexed in:\\n d - the previous 24 hours w - the previous seven days m - the previous month y - past year mn - the previous n number of months. So m2 would be the previous two, m3 would be three, and so on. Does work into double digits \\n 8. Find pages with specific usage rights \\nas_rights=xxx\\nLimits the search to files/pages that have certain rights. The options are:\\n (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use or share (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_nonderived).-(cc_noncommercial) - free to use or share, including commercially (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial).-(cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike).-(cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify commercially \\nIf you want to make up your own, put the bits you want in brackets, separated by pipe characters (|), and exclude the bits you don\\'t by putting them in brackets, preceded by .- and again pipe-separated.\\n 9. Do an allintitle search as a query string \\nallintitle%3Asearch+terms\\nThis is actually appended to the q= parameter, hence a search for fishing with the allintitle term \"sea bass\" would require the following query:\\nq=fishing+allintitle%3Asea+bass\\n Shows as allintitle:search terms \\nN.B. This also works with allintext to search page body text, allinurl for searching the URL, and allinanchor for finding sites that are linked to with certain anchor text.   \\n 10. Find products in a specific price range \\nnnn..yyyy\\nLike the allin parameters, this is actually appended to the q= parameter. What this does though is let you search for results between numeric ranges. For example, if you wanted to find documents with numbers between 15 and 100, you\\'d put in 15..100. Very useful for finding products in a price range, when combined with the site limiter. Works with $, £, and other such things.\\n Shows as query 15..100 \\n 11. Do + searches as a query string  \\n%2Bterm\\nAgain, this is appended to the q= parameter. The %2B is actually the + sign encoded, and will return results featuring only the term used, with no pluralisations, alternate tenses, or synonyms.\\n Shows as +term \\n        12. Find results for your search term, and synonyms    \\n~term\\nAnother one that\\'s appended to the q= parameter. Returns results for the term used and synonyms.\\n Shows as ~term \\n      13. Find definitions for your search term    \\ndefine%3Aword\\nYet another q= parameter add-on. Returns definitions for the word you put in.\\n Shows as define:word \\n 14. Find results for two words that can have other words in between  \\nterm * term two\\nAnd another q= parameter add-on. Returns results with listings that contain both words, with other words between them.\\n 15. Use Google\\'s calculator via query string \\nn+n2, n-n2, n/n2, n*n2, n^n2 and n% of n2\\nGoogle\\'s calculator functions. They are, in order, add, subtract, divide, multiply, raise to the power of, and return x percentage of.\\n 16. Modify safe search \\nsafe=active\\nSets safe search to on. To turn it off, change active to images.\\n 17. Find similar sites \\nas_rq=example.com\\nFinds sites Google thinks are related to the URL you put in.\\n Shows as query related:example.com \\n   18. View a site\\'s backlinks  \\nas_lq=example.com\\nFinds sites that link to the URL you put in.\\n Shows as query link:example.com \\n 19. Open a new window  \\nnewwindow=n\\nOpens clicked listings in a new window. Very useful for opening lots of documents at a time, for competitor research. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\\n 20  . Modify personalized search  \\npws\\nControls whether personalised search is on or not. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\\n 21 . Stop Adwords from collecting data \\nadtest=on\\nTurns off AdWords database connection, so your browsing won\\'t show up as an impression, and will disable the URLs. Set to on to activate, and off to turn it off.\\n 22 . Simulate a button click \\nbtnG=Search\\nSimulates a click on the normal Google results buttom. Change to btnI to get the I\\'m Feeling Lucky button result.\\n 23 . Change input encoding settings \\nie=\\nControls the input encoding settings. This defaults to UTF-8, and is worked out server-side, hence changing it doesn\\'t do anything.\\n 24 . Change output encoding settings \\noe=\\nControls the output encoding settings. Works in the same way as ie, so you can tinker away, but it won\\'t do anything.\\n 25 . Change language \\n&amp;hl=value\\nChanges the interface language. I won\\'t list them all here, but you can find them all here. \\n 26 . Limit languages \\nlr=value\\nLimits the languages used to return results. Not hugely effective. That said, here\\'s the list of all of them:\\n lang_ar - Arabic lang_hy - Armenian lang_be - Belarusian lang_bg - Bulgarian lang_ca - Catalan lang_hr - Croatian lang_cs - Czech lang_da - Danish lang_nl - Dutch lang_en - English lang_eo - Esperanto lang_et - Estonian lang_tl - Filipino lang_fi - Finnish lang_fr - French lang_de - German lang_el - Greek lang_iw - Hebrew lang_hu - Hungarian lang_is - Icelandic lang_id - Indonesian lang_it - Italian lang_ja - Japanese lang_ko - Korean lang_lv - Latvian lang_lt - Lithuanian lang_no - Norwegian lang_fa - Persian lang_pl - Polish lang_pt - Portuguese lang_ro - Romanian lang_ru - Russian lang_sr - Serbian lang_sk - Slovak lang_sl - Slovenian lang_es - Spanish lang_sv - Swedish lang_th - Thai lang_tr - Turkish lang_uk - Ukrainian lang_vi - Vietnamese lang_zh-CN - Chinese Simplified lang_zh-TW - Chinese Traditional \\n 27 . Only view pages from certain locations \\ncr=countryXX\\nLimits the search results to pages/sites from certain locations. Change XX to any of the following, to limit the results:\\n AF - Afghanistan AL - Albania DZ - Algeria AS - American Samoa AD - Andorra AO - Angola AI - Anguilla AQ - Antarctica AG - Antigua and Barbuda AR - Argentina AM - Armenia AW - Aruba AU - Australia AT - Austria AZ - Azerbaijan BS - Bahamas BH - Bahrain BD - Bangladesh BB - Barbados BY - Belarus BE - Belgium BZ - Belize BJ - Benin BM - Bermuda BT - Bhutan BO - Bolivia BA - Bosnia and Herzegovina BW - Botswana BV - Bouvet Island BR - Brazil IO - British Indian Ocean Territory VG - British Virgin Islands BN - Brunei BG - Bulgaria BF - Burkina Faso BI - Burundi KH - Cambodia CM - Cameroon CA - Canada CV - Cape Verde KY - Cayman Islands CF - Central African Republic TD - Chad CL - Chile CN - China CX - Christmas Island CC - Cocos (Keeling) Islands CO - Colombia KM - Comoros CG - Congo - Brazzaville CD - Congo - Kinshasa CK - Cook Islands CR - Costa Rica CI - Cote d\\'Ivoire HR - Croatia CU - Cuba CY - Cyprus CZ - Czech Republic DK - Denmark DJ - Djibouti DM - Dominica DO - Dominican Republic EC - Ecuador EG - Egypt SV - El Salvador GQ - Equatorial Guinea ER - Eritrea EE - Estonia SZ - Eswatini ET - Ethiopia FK - Falkland Islands (Malvinas) FO - Faroe Islands FJ - Fiji FI - Finland FR - France GF - French Guiana PF - French Polynesia TF - French Southern Territories GA - Gabon GM - Gambia GE - Georgia DE - Germany GH - Ghana GI - Gibraltar GR - Greece GL - Greenland GD - Grenada GP - Guadeloupe GU - Guam GT - Guatemala GN - Guinea GW - Guinea-Bissau GY - Guyana HT - Haiti HM - Heard and McDonald Islands VA - Holy Sea HN - Honduras HK - Hong Kong HU - Hungary IS - Iceland IN - India ID - Indonesia IQ - Iraq IE - Ireland IL - Israel IT - Italy JM - Jamaica JP - Japan JO - Jordan KZ - Kazakhstan KE - Kenya KI - Kiribati KP - Korea, Democratic People\\'s Republic of KR - Korea, Republic of KW - Kuwait KG - Kyrgyzstan LA - Lao People\\'s Democratic Republic LV - Latvia LB - Lebanon LS - Lesotho LR - Liberia LY - Libyan Arab Jamahiriya LI - Liechtenstein LT - Lithuania LU - Luxembourg MO - Macau MK - Macedonia MG - Madagascar MW - Malawi MY - Malaysia MV - Maldives ML - Mali MT - Malta MH - Marshall Islands MQ - Martinique MR - Mauritania MU - Mauritius YT - Mayotte MX - Mexico FM - Micronesia, Federated States of MD - Moldova, Republic of MC - Monaco MN - Mongolia MS - Montserrat MA - Morocco MZ - Mozambique MM - Myanmar NA - Namibia NR - Nauru NP - Nepal NL - Netherlands AN - Netherlands Antilles NC - New Caledonia NZ - New Zealand NI - Nicaragua NE - Niger NG - Nigeria NU - Niue NF - Norfolk Island MP - Northern Mariana Islands NO - Norway OM - Oman PK - Pakistan PW - Palau PS - Palestinian Territory PA - Panama PG - Papua New Guinea PY - Paraguay PE - Peru PH - Philippines PN - Pitcairn PL - Poland PT - Portugal PR - Puerto Rico QA - Qatar RE - Reunion RO - Romania RU - Russian Federation RW - Rwanda SH - Saint Helena KN - Saint Kitts and Nevis LC - Saint Lucia PM - Saint Pierre &amp; Miquelon VC - Saint Vincent and the Grenadines WS - Samoa SM - San Marino ST - Sao Tome and Principe SA - Saudi Arabia SN - Senegal CS - Serbia and Montenegro SC - Seychelles SL - Sierra Leone SG - Singapore SK - Slovakia SI - Slovenia SB - Solomon Islands SO - Somalia ZA - South Africa GS - South Georgia and The South Sandwich Islands ES - Spain LK - Sri Lanka SD - Sudan SR - Suriname SJ - Svalbard &amp; Jan Mayen SE - Sweden CH - Switzerland SY - Syrian Arab Republic TW - Taiwan TJ - Tajikistan TZ - Tanzania TH - Thailand TL - Timor-Leste TG - Togo TK - Tokelau TO - Tonga TT - Trinidad and Tobago TN - Tunisia TR - Turkey TM - Turkmenistan TC - Turks and Caicos Islands TV - Tuvalu UG - Uganda UA - Ukraine AE - United Arab Emirates GB - United Kingdom US - United States UM - United States Minor Outlying Islands UY - Uruguay UZ - Uzbekistan VU - Vanuatu VE - Venezuela VN - Viet Nam VG - Virgin Islands (British) VI - Virgin Islands (U.S.) WF - Wallis and Futuna Islands EH - Western Sahara YE - Yemen ZM - Zambia ZW - Zimbabwe \\nKeep learning\\n  Mastering Google Search Operators in 67 Easy Steps   SEO Essentials Certification   Beginner\\'s Guide to SEO: How Search Engines Work: Crawling, Indexing, and Ranking   \\n \\nPut your skills to work\\nGauge a Site\\'s Influence with Link Explorer\\nLink Explorer is a link popularity and backlink analysis tool that lets you research and compare any site on the web.'] market_size=0 growth_potential=0.0 key_characteristics=[]\n",

Successful researchers frequently enter several queries to find what they’re seeking.\\nThe search boxes at the top and bottom of the results page show the query for the current results page. If the query uses special operators that you entered either directly or indirectly through the advanced search form, they will appear in the search box as well. To refine your query, edit what’s in the search box and then click the Google Search button or hit the  ENTER  key.\\nLet’s look at a few examples.\\nGet ideas for subsequent searches by reviewing your results, including the snippets that Google returns and the pages they came from.\\nShould you get a flu shot this winter?\\nTRY [ flu shot ]\\nMany of the results refer to influenza vaccine.\\nREFINE [ flu OR influenza shot OR vaccine ]\\nExploit successful queries: look deeper within your results.\\nScroll to the search box at the bottom of your results page and click on the link “Search within results.” This causes Google to run a new search using your newly specified terms (those in the search box) only on the pages it found from your initial query, rather than a search over the entire web.\\n \\nYou can get the same results in one step fewer by simply specifying additional terms to your previous query.\\nOn Internet Explorer and on some other browsers, you can change a term or an entire query easily. First, highlight the part you want to change by double-clicking a word, or triple-clicking to highlight the entire query. Then either press the  DELETE  key to remove the highlighted text or type new text to replace it.\\nFor example, to change “great vacation spots” to “great vacation areas,” double-click on the word “spots” below and type “areas.”\\n  Instead of searching for related topics with a single query, divide the query into several parts.

In the examples below, click on the similar ways of specifying various searches and note how the results differ.\\nFor simplicity sake, this tutorial uses square brackets to denote Google’s search box. For example, to search for a cheap hotel in Mykonos, I’ll put the words “cheap,” “hotel,” and “Mykonos” in square brackets, [ cheap hotel Mykonos ], to indicate you should type those three words in Google’s search box. You should not type the brackets, although Google will ignore them if you do type them.\\nFurthermore, in the examples that follow, each set of search terms is linked to the results of a Google search on those terms. So clicking on [ cheap Mykonos hotel ] returns the Google results page for a search on those three words.\\n  1. Use Likely Words\\n Use words likely to appear on the pages you want. \\n[ salary negotiation tips ]\\n[ sciatica ]\\n[ window treatments ]\\nAvoid using a question as a query. For example, the query, [ Does Australia have Target ], instructs Google to find pages containing all the terms. Such a query won’t necessarily find pages answering your question. A better query might be [ Australia Target store ].\\nUSE [ Australia Target store ]\\nNOT [ Does Australia have Target ]\\nWhen Google detects very common words such as where, do, I, for, and a, known as  stop words , it ignores them so Google may return relevant results. If you’re seeking pages that include a stop word, e.g., “how the west was won,” learn how to force Google to search for a complete phrase or a specific word in  Crafting Your Query  and the following pages.\\nAvoid using words that you might associate with your topic, but you wouldn’t expect to find on the designated page(s). For example, queries that include “articles about,” “discussion of,” “documentation on,” and “pages about” are likely to return fewer results since information on the web is rarely labeled with such terms.\\nUSE [ lasik eye surgery ]\\nNOT [ documentation on lasik eye surgery ]\\nUSE [ jobs product marketing Sunnyvale ]\\nNOT [ listings of product marketing jobs in Sunnyvale ]\\nSuppose you want to know how old someone is, such as Nelson Mandela (the former President of South Africa). Pages with “birthday” or “age” might be more than a year old. Searching for pages that include “Nelson Mandela” and “born” are likely to include either “Nelson Mandela born” or “Nelson Mandela was born” followed by his birth date. You can figure out his age from knowing when he was born (to do the math, try the Google Calculator).\\nUSE [ Nelson Mandela born ]\\nNOT [ Nelson Mandela birthday ] nor [ Nelson Mandela age ]\\nNot sure what word or phrase is likely to appear on pages you want? Consider running a word or phrase popularity contest with Google Fight, which you can find at www.googlefight.com. This third-party application reports which of two terms or phrases Google estimates to be more prevalent on the web (actually on more web pages that Google has included in its index).\\n \\nGoogle Fight found 48,900,000 uses of “screen shot” but only 3,620,000 uses of “screenshot”. (In 2004, using a previous version of Google Fight named Google Smackdown, “screenshot” was more popular than “screen shot”.)\\n Note: How Google Works describes how Google finds web pages and constructs an index.\\n  2. Be Specific\\n Be specific: Use more query terms to narrow your results. \\nIt’s better to use a more precise, less ambiguous term than a common one to “flesh out the topic by including facets that interest you,” notes Ned Fielden in his book Internet Research, Second Edition (McFarland &amp; Company, 2001).\\nDoes your query have enough specific information for Google to determine unambiguously what you’re seeking? If your query is too vague, it’s unlikely to return relevant results. Consider, for example, the query [ java ]. What do you suppose Google includes in the first page of results? An island in Indonesia? A beverage consisting of an infusion of ground coffee beans? A computer network-oriented platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems?\\nUSE [ Java Indonesia ], [ java coffee ], or [ java programming language ]\\nNOT [ java ]\\nHow can you come up with more specific search terms? What do you know about the topic? Consider answers to the questions, “who?”, “what?”, “where?”, “when?”, “why?”, and “how?”\\nWhen you search for [ Tom Watson ], on the first page of results you may get references to a member of Parliament, the golfer, the IBM executive, and a Populist Party candidate for President in 1900 and 1904. If you’re searching for something that could return many different types of results, you should add a term that distinguishes among them. This way you’ll get only results about the specific Tom Watson you’re interested in.\\nUSE [ Tom Watson MP ], [ Tom Watson golf ], or [ Tom Watson IBM ]\\nNOT [ Tom Watson ]\\nUSE [ baby development ] or [ baby milestones ]\\nNOT [ babies ]\\nUSE [ Betty Ford Center drug addiction ]\\nNOT [ Ford Center ]\\n Note: Google limits queries to 32 words.\\n  3. Brevity\\nFor best results, use a few precise words. For example, a program on quitting smoking is more likely to include the terms “quit smoking program” than the words “program on quitting tobacco cigarette smoking addiction.”\\nUSE [ quit smoking program ]\\nNOT [ program on quitting tobacco cigarette smoking addiction ]\\n  4. Spelling\\n You don’t have to correct your spelling. \\nThere’s a good chance that Google will recognize your mistakes and suggest an alternative more common spelling, usually faster than you can look up the term in an online dictionary.\\nWhen you enter: [ Anna Kornikova tennis ]\\nGoogle responds: Did you mean: Anna Kournikova tennis \\n Note: Before clicking on Google’s suggested spelling, consider whether it’s what you want. Spelling checkers, like people, make mistakes.\\nFor more information on Google’s spelling correction system, see Spelling Suggestions.\\n Note: Even if you use the search tips described in Google Guide, you won’t be able to access authoritative information that’s available offline, e.g., old reference books, or is stored in specialized databases. For such information is not currently searchable with Google.\\nNext we’ll look at how Google interprets your query.\\nFor more information on the basics of Google search, visit How to search on Google.\\n Exercises \\nThese problems give you experience in selecting search terms.

Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\nTo find information on volunteering for an organization, search for results with the word “volunteering” and restrict the domain to “.org”. Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\n  5. Date\\nHere you can restrict results to pages that have been updated (created or modified), crawled, and added to Google’s index (indexed) in the past three, six, or twelve months. Popular pages that are updated often are crawled and indexed frequently.\\n Note: Any change in the page counts as an update, even a spelling correction.\\nThis option is useful when searching for timely information such as annual events, specifications for a new model of car or appliance, or what people have been doing lately.\\nRecently, scientists reported new findings about the risks and benefits of hormone therapy used by 40% of postmenopausal American women to relieve menopause symptoms. We’re more likely to find links to this information by searching only for web pages updated in the last three months. Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\n(Choosing the date range doesn’t affect what you’ll see in the box “your advanced search will appear here” at the top of the form. However, after performing the search, the URL at the top of your browser window should include the text &amp;as_qdr=m3; it specifies 3 months.)\\nVisit the Wayback Machine if you want to see what a site looked like months or years ago or if a site is currently inaccessible. The Wayback Machine, also known as the Internet Archive, maintains a digital library of snapshots of many Internet sites.\\n  6. Usage Rights\\nFor pages covered by the Creative Commons license, Usage Rights: lets you specify what types of usage the page should allow.\\nIn general — unless a page states otherwise — it’s safe to assume that pages you find with Google cannot be freely used in any way you like. However, some pages have special marking to tell search engines such as Google that the page is covered by the Creative Commons license — and what types of usage are permitted. The Usage Rights search finds these specially-marked pages.\\nYour choices are:\\nUsage Rights\\nDescription\\nnot filtered by license\\nstandard, unfiltered Google results\\nfree to use or share\\nresults you can copy or redistribute\\nfree to use or share, even commercially\\nresults you can copy or redistribute for profit\\nfree to use share or modify\\nresults you can copy or adapt, as well as redistribute\\nfree to use, share or modify, even commercially\\nresults you can copy or adapt, as well as redistribute, for profit\\nNote that simply finding pages with the Usage Rights search doesn’t guarantee your rights. You should check each page to be sure about its usage terms.\\nLet’s say that you want to build a website with recipes for vegetables. We’ll find pages on Google with Usage Rights “free to use, share or modify, even commercially”\\n   \\n(Specifying usage rights doesn’t change what you’ll see in the box at the top of the form. Setting this drop-down box makes a change in your browser’s URL that can be complicated. If you’re curious, experiment with various settings and check the URL you get after clicking the Advanced Search button.)\\n  7. Occurrences\\nThe field labeled Where your keywords show up: lets you specify where your search terms must occur on the page. Choices are anywhere on the page, in the title, in the text, in the URL, or in links to the page.\\nThe  title  of a webpage is usually displayed at the top of the browser window and in the first line of Google’s search results for a page. The author of a website specifies the title of a page with the HTML &lt;TITLE&gt; element. There’s only one title in a webpage.\\n The Uniform Resource Locator, more commonly known as URL, is the address that specifies the location of a file on the Internet.\\nThe  link  is the text on a page that is linked to another web page or a different place on the current page. When you click on the link, you will be taken to the page or place on the page to which it is linked.\\nFind pages on Google whose URL contains FAQ, an abbreviation for either Frequently Asked Questions or Frequently Answered Question. In the solution below I look for pages containing both Google and FAQ in the URL. Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\n  8. Region\\nHere you can request pages from a particular country or region of the world. (The results may show URLs from that part of the world, or they may end in more common domains like “.com”. In the latter case, the page may be from a regional version of a multinational website.)\\nTo read pages from South Africa about President Clinton or Senator Clinton, click on the image to perform the search:\\n   \\n(Choosing the region doesn’t change the search shown in the box at the top of the form. After you search, though, the URL at the top of your browser window should include the text &amp;cr=countryZA; ZA is the code for South Africa — and its Internet domain.)\\n  9. Numeric Range\\nUse Numeric Range: when you want pages containing numbers in a specified range.\\nWhen I was interested in a “half-bicycle” trailer for my young twins, I searched for one called Trail-a-Bike in the price range $50-$1000. Click on the image below to perform the search:\\n   \\n(In this case, I could also have used Google’s Product Search.)\\n  10. SafeSearch\\nThe SafeSearch: area allows you to filter out sites that contain pornography or explicit sexual content and eliminate them from search results. Be aware that Google’s automated filtering doesn’t guarantee that you won’t be shown offensive content.\\nWhen you turn off SafeSearch filtering and search for non-pornographic content, Google will order your results in a way that adult sites won’t be listed prominently. For example, searching for [ breast cancer treatment ] with SafeSearch turned off, you’re unlikely to run across sites with provocative images of breasts.\\n   \\nIn an effort to return as many useful results as possible, SafeSearch doesn’t currently filter out hate speech, anarchy, criminal activity, crude and tasteless material, illegal weapons, bomb making, etc., content that other filtering systems attempt to exclude.\\n  11. Page-Specific Searches\\nThe “Page-specific tools:” search boxes are no longer part of the Advanced Search form.Use the search operators listed below — related: and link:.\\nThe Advanced Search form also offers page-specific searches for finding pages similar to a page for which you have a web address (URL) and for finding out what pages link to a particular page.\\n  To find pages similar to Consumer Reports’ web page, fill in the first page-specific search box, Find pages similar to the page:. Then click on the associated Search button. For a description of how Google determines when pages are similar, see How does Google find similar pages?.\\n \\n(The page-specific searches are separate from the rest of the Advanced Search form, so they don’t change the box at the top of the form with the gray text “Use the form below and your advanced search will appear here.” After you search, though, the Google Search box near the top of the results page should begin with the search operator related: — in this example, related:www.consumerreports.org.) \\n  Web pages link from one to another. Links are unidirectional; you can follow links from one page to another. You cannot traverse the link the other way around, i.e., go from a page to the pages that link to it. However, Google keeps track of this information and makes it available. When you want to know who links to your website or to someone else’s, fill in a web address (URL) in the page-specific search section Find pages that link to the page:. Let’s find who links to the Doctors without Borders, aka  Médecins Sans Frontières  (MSF), website www.doctorswithoutborders.org.\\n   \\n(As for the similar-page search, you won’t see link-search terms in the box at the top of the Advanced Search page. However, the Google Search box near the top of the results page should begin with the search operator link: — in this example, link:www.doctorswithoutborders.org.)\\nThe most common users of backward links are webmasters and website publishers who are curious to know what sites link to theirs. People also use them to find out who links to competitors’ sites. \\nUnlike the other fields in the Advanced Search form, the page-specific searches can’t be combined with other query terms. Consequently each has its own Search button.\\nYou can easily run these page-specific searches from Google’s Toolbar.\\n   Instead of going to the Advanced Search form, you can search for a web site by entering its address in the search box and Google returns a link to the website, as well as links to:\\nGoogle’s cache of the site\\nWeb pages that are similar to the site\\nWeb pages that link to the site\\nAll Web pages from the site that Google has crawled, listed in PageRank order\\nWeb pages that contain the URL\\nFor example, to find out about the wonderful reference site www.refdesk.com, enter  www.refdesk.com  into Google’s search box.\\n \\n tags (keywords):  advanced search, creative commons license, date, domain, file format, language, narrowing search, numbers, phrase, queries, safe search, search terms, URLs \\nYou can narrow results for complex searches with Advanced Search. For example, you can find sites in German that were updated in the last 24 hours or clip art images in black and white.\\n Tip: In the Google search box, you can use Advanced Search filters with search operators like quotes, minus signs, and site:.

How can we improve it? \\nThe following table lists the search operators that work with each Google search service. Click on an operator to jump to its description — or, to read about all of the operators, simply scroll down and read all of this page. The following is an alphabetical list of the search operators. This list includes operators that are not officially supported by Google and not listed in Google\\'s brief online help Refine web searches. Each entry typically includes the syntax, the capabilities, and an example. Some of the search operators won’t work as intended if you put a space between the colon (:) and the subsequent query word. If you don’t care to check which search operators require no space after the colon, always place the keyword immediately next to the colon. Many search operators can appear anywhere in your query. In our examples, we place the search operator as far to the right as possible. We do this because the Advanced Search form writes queries in this way. Also, such a convention makes it clearer as to which operators are associated with which terms. \\n   allinanchor: \\nIf you start your query with allinanchor:, Google restricts results to pages containing all query terms you specify in the anchor text on links to the page. For example, [ allinanchor: best museums sydney ] will return only pages in which the anchor text on links to the pages contain the words “best,” “museums,” and “sydney.”\\n  Anchor text is the text on a page that is linked to another web page or a different place on the current page. When you click on anchor text, you will be taken to the page or place on the page to which it is linked. When using allinanchor: in your query, do not include any other search operators. The functionality of allinanchor: is also available through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\n   allintext: \\nIf you start your query with allintext:, Google restricts results to those containing all the query terms you specify in the text of the page. For example, [ allintext: travel packing list ] will return only pages in which the words “travel,” “packing,” and “list” appear in the text of the page. This functionality can also be obtained through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\n   allintitle: \\nIf you start your query with allintitle:, Google restricts results to those containing all the query terms you specify in the title. For example, [ allintitle: detect plagiarism ] will return only documents that contain the words “detect” and “plagiarism” in the title. This functionality can also be obtained through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\nThe  title  of a webpage is usually displayed at the top of the browser window and in the first line of Google’s search results for a page. The author of a website specifies the title of a page with the HTML TITLE element. There’s only one title in a webpage. When using allintitle: in your query, do not include any other search operators. The functionality of allintitle: is also available through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\nIn Image Search, the operator allintitle: will return images in files whose names contain the terms that you specify.\\nIn Google News, the operator allintitle: will return articles whose titles include the terms you specify.\\n   allinurl: \\nIf you start your query with allinurl:, Google restricts results to those containing all the query terms you specify in the URL. For example, [ allinurl: google faq ] will return only documents that contain the words “google” and “faq” in the URL, such as “www.google.com/help/faq.html”. This functionality can also be obtained through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\nIn URLs, words are often run together. They need not be run together when you’re using allinurl:.\\nIn Google News, the operator allinurl: will return articles whose titles include the terms you specify.\\n The Uniform Resource Locator, more commonly known as URL, is the address that specifies the location of a file on the Internet. When using allinurl: in your query, do not include any other search operators. The functionality of allinurl: is also available through the Advanced Web Search page, under Occurrences.\\n   author: \\nIf you include author: in your query, Google will restrict your Google Groups results to include newsgroup articles by the author you specify. The author can be a full or partial name or email address. For example, [ children author:john author:doe ] or [ children author:doe@someaddress.com ] return articles that contain the word “children” written by John Doe or doe@someaddress.com.\\nGoogle will search for exactly what you specify. If your query contains [ author:”John Doe” ] (with quotes), Google won’t find articles where the author is specified as “Doe, John.”\\n   cache: \\nThe query cache:url  will display Google’s cached version of a web page, instead of the current version of the page. For example, [ cache:www.eff.org ] will show Google’s cached version of the Electronic Frontier Foundation home page.\\n Note: Do not put a space between cache: and the URL (web address).\\nOn the cached version of a page, Google will highlight terms in your query that appear after the cache: search operator. For example, [ cache:www.pandemonia.com/flying/ fly diary ] will show Google’s cached version of Flight Diary in which Hamish Reid’s documents what’s involved in learning how to fly with the terms “fly” and “diary” highlighted.\\n   define: \\nIf you start your query with define:, Google shows definitions from pages on the web for the term that follows. This advanced search operator is useful for finding definitions of words, phrases, and acronyms. For example, [ define: blog ] will show definitions for “Blog” (weB LOG).\\n   ext: \\nThis is an undocumented alias for filetype:.\\n   filetype: \\nIf you include filetype:suffix  in your query, Google will restrict the results to pages whose names end in  suffix . For example, [ web page evaluation checklist filetype:pdf ] will return Adobe Acrobat pdf files that match the terms “web,” “page,” “evaluation,” and “checklist.” You can restrict the results to pages whose names end with pdf and doc by using the OR operator, e.g. [ email security filetype:pdf OR filetype:doc ].\\n   When you don’t specify a File Format in the Advanced Search Form or the filetype: operator, Google searches a variety of file formats; see the table in File Type Conversion.\\n   group: \\nIf you include group: in your query, Google will restrict your Google Groups results to newsgroup articles from certain groups or subareas. For example, [ sleep group:misc.kids.moderated ] will return articles in the group misc.kids.moderated that contain the word “sleep” and [ sleep group:misc.kids ] will return articles in the subarea misc.kids that contain the word “sleep.”\\n   id: \\nThis is an undocumented alias for info:.\\n   inanchor: \\nIf you include inanchor: in your query, Google will restrict the results to pages containing the query terms you specify in the anchor text or links to the page. For example, [ restaurants inanchor:gourmet ] will return pages in which the anchor text on links to the pages contain the word “gourmet” and the page contains the word “restaurants.”\\n   info: \\nThe query info: URL   will present some information about the corresponding web page. For instance, [ info:gothotel.com ] will show information about the national hotel directory GotHotel.com home page.\\n Note: There must be no space between the info: and the web page URL.\\nThis functionality can also be obtained by typing the web page URL directly into a Google search box.\\n   insubject: \\nIf you include insubject: in your query, Google will restrict articles in Google Groups to those that contain the terms you specify in the subject. For example, [ insubject:”falling asleep” ] will return Google Group articles that contain the phrase “falling asleep” in the subject.\\nEquivalent to intitle:.\\n   intext: \\nThe query intext:term  restricts results to documents containing  term  in the text. For instance, [ Hamish Reid intext:pandemonia ] will return documents that mention the word “pandemonia” in the text, and mention the names “Hamish” and “Reid” anywhere in the document (text or not).\\n Note: There must be no space between the intext: and the following word.\\nPutting intext: in front of every word in your query is equivalent to putting allintext: at the front of your query, e.g., [ intext:handsome intext:poets ] is the same as [ allintext: handsome poets ].\\n   intitle: \\nThe query intitle:term  restricts results to documents containing  term  in the title. For instance, [ flu shot intitle:help ] will return documents that mention the word “help” in their titles, and mention the words “flu” and “shot” anywhere in the document (title or not).\\n Note: There must be no space between the intitle: and the following word.\\nPutting intitle: in front of every word in your query is equivalent to putting allintitle: at the front of your query, e.g., [ intitle:google intitle:search ] is the same as [ allintitle: google search ].\\n   inurl: \\nIf you include inurl: in your query, Google will restrict the results to documents containing that word in the URL. For instance, [ inurl:print site:www.googleguide.com ] searches for pages on Google Guide in which the URL contains the word “print.” It finds pdf files that are in the directory or folder named “print” on the Google Guide website. The query [ inurl:healthy eating ] will return documents that mention the words “healthy” in their URL, and mention the word “eating” anywhere in the document.\\n Note: There must be no space between the inurl: and the following word.\\nPutting inurl: in front of every word in your query is equivalent to putting allinurl: at the front of your query, e.g., [ inurl:healthy inurl:eating ] is the same as [ allinurl: healthy eating ].\\nIn URLs, words are often run together. They need not be run together when you’re using inurl:.\\n   link: \\nThe query link:URL  shows pages that point to that   URL  . For example, to find pages that point to Google Guide’s home page, enter:\\n[ link:www.googleguide.com ]\\n Note: According to Google’s documentation, “you cannot combine a link: search with a regular keyword search.”\\nAlso note that when you combine link: with another advanced operator, Google may not return all the pages that match. The following queries should return lots of results, as you can see if you remove the -site: term in each of these queries.\\nFind links to the Google home page not on Google’s own site.\\n[ link:www.google.com -site:google.com ]\\nFind links to the UK Owners Direct home page not on its own site.\\n[ link:www.www.ownersdirect.co.uk -site:ownersdirect.co.uk ]\\n   location: \\nIf you include location: in your query on Google News, only articles from the location you specify will be returned. For example, [ queen location:canada ] will show articles that match the term “queen” from sites in Canada. Many other country names work; try them and see.\\nTwo-letter US state abbreviations match individual US states, and two-letter Canadian province abbreviations (like NS for Nova Scotia) also work — although some provinces don’t have many newspapers online, so you may not get many results. Some other two-letter abbreviations — such as UK for the United Kingdom — are also available.\\n   movie: \\nIf you include movie: in your query, Google will find movie-related information. For examples, see Google’s Blog.\\n   related: \\nThe query related: URL   will list web pages that are similar to the web page you specify. For instance, [ related:www.consumerreports.org ] will list web pages that are similar to the Consumer Reports home page.\\n Note: Don’t include a space between the related: and the web page url.\\nYou can also find similar pages from the “Similar pages” link on Google’s main results page, and from the similar selector in the Page-Specific Search area of the Advanced Search page. If you expect to search frequently for similar pages, consider installing a GoogleScout browser button, which scouts for similar pages.\\n   site: \\nIf you include site: in your query, Google will restrict your search results to the site or domain you specify. For example, [ admissions site:www.lse.ac.uk ] will show admissions information from London School of Economics’ site and [ peace site:gov ] will find pages about peace within the .gov domain. You can specify a domain with or without a period, e.g., either as .gov or gov.\\n Note: Do not include a space between the “site:” and the domain.\\nYou can use many of the search operators in conjunction with the basic search operators +, –, OR, and \" \". For example, to find information on Windows security from all sites except microsoft.com, enter:\\n[ windows security –site:microsoft.com ]\\nYou can also restrict your results to a site or domain through the domains selector on the Advanced Search page.\\n   source: \\nIf you include source: in your query, Google News will restrict your search to articles from the news source with the ID you specify. For example, [ election source:new_york_times ] will return articles with the word “election” that appear in the New York Times.\\nTo find a news source ID, enter a query that includes a term and the name of the publication you’re seeking. You can also specify the publication name in the “news source” field in the Advanced News Search form. You’ll find the news source ID in the query box, following the source: search operator. For example, let’s say you enter the publication name Ha’aretz in the News Source box, then you click the Google Search button. The results page appears, and its search box contains [ peace source:ha_aretz__subscription_ ]. This means that the news source ID is ha_aretz__subscription_. This query will only return articles that include the word “peace” from the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz.\\n   weather \\nIf you enter a query with the word weather and a city or location name, if Google recognizes the location, the forecast will appear at the top of the results page. Otherwise, your results will usually include links to sites with the weather conditions and forecast for that location.\\nSince weather is not an advanced operator, there is no need to include a colon after the word. For example, [ weather Sunnyvale CA ] will return the weather for Sunnyvale, California and [ weather 94041 ] will return the weather for the city containing the zip code (US postal code) 94041, which is Mountain View, California.\\n The Google Guide Advanced Operator Quick Reference (www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators_reference.html) provides a nice summary of the search operators grouped by type. It includes search operators not yet documented by Google, e.g.,  allinanchor: ,  allintext: ,  author: ,  ext: ,  group: ,  id: ,  insubject: ,  intext: ,  intitle: ,  location: , and  source: . This problem set is designed to give you experiences with search operators and practice with specifying more precisely what you’re seeking by using the Advanced Search form.

Exploring topics is a relatively simple process, and Trends includes some features and options to help refine your results. There are several ways to get the precise data you need to help prompt a story idea or support a point. \\nRefining your search using punctuation.\\n You can use punctuation to filter your Trends search results. For example, if you’re writing a story about alternative energy and search the term wind farm, with no punctuation, your results will contain both words in any order, along with other words (offshore wind farm, new methods to farm wind, wind saves the farm, etc.). No misspellings, spelling variations, synonyms, plural or singular versions of your terms will be included. \\nPunctuation guide.\\nHere’s how various punctuation can affect this search:\\nStep\\n1\\n“wind farm” – Double quotation marks around your term give results that include that exact term, possibly with words before and after (offshore wind farm, for example).\\nStep\\n2\\nwind + solar – Results can include the words wind OR solar.\\nStep\\n3\\nwind - farm – Results will include the word wind, but exclude the word farm. This is useful when searching a term that’s part of a popular phrase you want to keep from dominating your results.\\nStep\\n4\\nfueling + fuelling + fueleing – Results will include alternative spellings (fueling or fuelling) plus common misspellings (fueleing).\\nRefining your search by region.\\n When you search for a term in Google Trends, your results will include a map of the world showing areas where your term is popular. Darker shades indicate where your term has a higher probability of being searched. Simply hovering over a region will activate a pop-up window that reveals its search volume index. On the right of the map is a list view icon that displays the ranking of top regions or cities based on your term’s popularity. \\nNarrowing or expanding each search topic by geography and time.\\nOn the results page, you can refine your exploration by region and/or time period for each individual search topic.\\nStep\\n1\\nFor example, if you compare search interest in Wave power and Solar power, you’ll find that Solar power typically outpaces the Wave power for worldwide search interest.\\nStep\\n2\\nIf you want to examine local interest in different regions, hover over your search term and click the three dots. Then select Change filters from the menu.\\nStep\\n3\\nSpecify the region and time period you want to review.\\nStep\\n4\\nThe results may reveal a different relationship between the two search terms than what was shown in the worldwide comparison.\\nExploring U.S. metropolitan areas.\\nTrends even allows you to refine your geographical breakdown to the city level. Metros are geographical areas that generally correspond to U.S. metropolitan areas. Currently, Google Trends only provides metros for the United States. Let’s say you are continuing to research a story about energy and you want to look at geothermal energy search trends. You can get information for a specific metro area one of two ways: \\nStep\\n1\\nClick Worldwide at the top of your results page.\\nStep\\n2\\nChoose United States.\\nStep\\n3\\nTo examine the data for each metro area, click a specific state.\\nStep\\n4\\nTo view the map by city or metro area, use the Subregion menu above the map.\\nRefining your results using categories.\\nIf you\\'re using Trends to search for a word with multiple meanings, you can filter your results by category to get data for the version you’re looking for. \\nStep\\n1\\nSearch for your term, and on the results page, click All categories under the search box to reveal your category choices.\\nStep\\n2\\nChoose a category most closely related to the meaning you prefer.The results will reflect the number of searches for that term in that context.\\nUsing rising data.\\n  Rising shows terms that were searched for with the term you entered (or overall, if no search term was entered) which had the most significant growth in volume in the requested time period. For each rising search term, you’ll see a percentage of the term’s growth compared to the previous time period. If you see the term “Breakout,” it means that the search term did not exist in the previous time period, and we have no baseline. The percentages are based on the percent increase in search interest for the selected time frame.  Using geothermal energy as an example, if we\\'re looking at the last 7 days, the benchmark for the rise in searches for the term geothermal energy would be 7 days prior; if it was the last 30 days, the benchmark would be for the 30 days prior.  The only exception is when viewing the full history (2004-Present), when the percentages are benchmarked at 2004. \\nFinding related queries.\\nWhen you search for a term, the Related queries chart will appear at the bottom of your results page. Related queries can be used to determine the top and rising terms associated to any topic or trending story. This can be useful for finding unique angles on a story, for example.\\nStep\\n1\\nOn the chart, click the Rising tab and select Top.\\nStep\\n2\\nTop displays terms that are most frequently searched with the term you entered, in the same search session, with the same chosen category, country or region.\\n||||I||||Skip to main content\\nmenu close\\n* Resources expand_more\\n+ Business Resources\\n+ Journalism Resources\\n+ Products\\n+ Programs\\n+ View All\\n* Case Studies & Research\\n* About expand_more\\n+ Impact\\n+ About\\nsearch search\\nclose\\nexpand_more\\n* English (GB)\\n* English\\n* العربيّة\\n* বাংলা\\n* Français\\n* Deutsch\\n* עברית\\n* हिंदी\\n* Bahasa Indonesia\\n* Italiano\\n* 한국어\\n* 日本語\\n* Nederlands\\n* Polski\\n* Português brasileiro\\n* Español (LatAm)\\n* Español\\n* ภาษาไทย\\n* Türkçe\\n* 繁體中文\\n* Česky\\n* Tiếng việt\\nSign In\\nResources keyboard_arrow_right\\nCase Studies & Research\\nAbout keyboard_arrow_right\\nkeyboard_arrow_left Resources\\n* Business Resources\\n* Journalism Resources\\n* Products\\n* Programs\\n* View All\\nkeyboard_arrow_left About\\n* Impact\\n* About\\nSign In\\nexpand_more\\n* English (GB)\\n* English\\n* العربيّة\\n* বাংলা\\n* Français\\n* Deutsch\\n* עברית\\n* हिंदी\\n* Bahasa Indonesia\\n* Italiano\\n* 한국어\\n* 日本語\\n* Nederlands\\n* Polski\\n* Português brasileiro\\n* Español (LatAm)\\n* Español\\n* ภาษาไทย\\n* Türkçe\\n* 繁體中文\\n* Česky\\n* Tiếng việt\\ninfo info Get started\\nNot sure where to start?

Search parameters can be used to construct your own search strings by typing them into the address bar, also called the Chrome omnibar.\\nA search operator might look like: \\nallintitle: tesla vs edison\\n \\nA search parameter might look like:\\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=\"nikola+tesla\"\\n \\nWhat are Google search operators?\\nGoogle search operators are special characters and commands sometimes called “advanced operators” or search parameters that extend the capabilities of regular text searches. Search operators can be useful for everything from content research to technical SEO audits.\\nHow do I use search operators?\\nYou can enter search operators directly into the Google search box, just as you would a text search:\\n \\nExcept in special cases (such as the “in” operator), Google will return standard organic results.\\nGoogle search operators cheat sheet\\nYou can find all of the major organic search operators below, broken up into three categories: “Basic”, “Advanced”, and “Unreliable”. Basic search operators are operators that modify standard text searches.\\n   I. Basic search operators     \" \"   \"nikola tesla\"  Put any phrase in quotes to force Google to use exact-match. On single words, prevents synonyms.   OR   tesla OR edison  Google search defaults to logical AND between terms. Specify \"OR\" for a logical OR (ALL-CAPS).   |   tesla | edison  The pipe (|) operator is identical to \"OR\". Useful if your Caps-lock is broken :)   ( )   (tesla OR edison) alternating current  Use parentheses to group operators and control the order in which they execute.   -   tesla -motors  Put minus (-) in front of any term (including operators) to exclude that term from the results.   *   tesla \"rock * roll\"  An asterisk (*) acts as a wild-card and will match on any word.   #..#   tesla announcement 2015..2017  Use (..) with numbers on either side to match on any integer in that range of numbers.   $   tesla deposit $1000  Search prices with the dollar sign ($). You can combine ($) and (.) for exact prices, like $19.99.   €   €9,99 lunch deals  Search prices with the Euro sign (€). Most other currency signs don\\'t seem to be honored by Google.    in   250 kph in mph  Use \"in\" to convert between two equivalent units. This returns a special, Knowledge Card style result.   \\nAdvanced search operators are special commands that modify searches and may require additional parameters (such as a domain name). Advanced operators are typically used to narrow searches and drill deeper into results.\\n   II. Advanced search operators     intitle:   intitle:\"tesla vs edison\"  Search only in the page\\'s title for a word or phrase. Use exact-match (quotes) for phrases.   allintitle:   allintitle: tesla vs edison  Search the page title for every individual term following \"allintitle:\". Same as multiple intitle:\\'s.   inurl:   tesla announcements inurl:2016  Look for a word or phrase (in quotes) in the document URL. Can combine with other terms.   allinurl:   allinurl: amazon field-keywords nikon  Search the URL for every individual term following \"allinurl:\". Same as multiple inurl:\\'s.   intext:   intext:\"orbi vs eero vs google wifi\"  Search for a word or phrase (in quotes), but only in the body/document text.   allintext:   allintext: orbi eero google wifi  Search the body text for every individual term following \"allintext:\". Same as multiple intexts:\\'s.   filetype:   \"tesla announcements\" filetype:pdf  Match only a specific file type. Some examples include PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT, and TXT.   related:   related:nytimes.com  Return sites that are related to a target domain. Only works for larger domains.   AROUND(X)   tesla AROUND(3) edison  Returns results where the two terms/phrases are within (X) words of each other.   \\nUnreliable operators have either been found to produce inconsistent results or have been deprecated altogether. The \"link:\" operator was officially deprecated in early 2017. It appears that \"inanchor:\" operators are still in use, but return very narrow and sometimes unreliable results. Use link-based operators only for initial research.\\n   III. Unreliable/deprecated operators     ~   ~cars  Include synonyms. Seems to be unreliable, and synonym inclusion is default now.   +   +cars  Force exact-match on a single phrase. Deprecated with the launch of Google+.   daterange:   tesla announcements daterange:2457663-2457754  Return results in the specified range. Can be inconsistent. Requires Julian dates.   link:   link:nytimes.com  Find pages that link to the target domain. This operator was deprecated in early 2017.   inanchor:   inanchor:\"tesla announcements\"  Find pages linked to with the specified anchor text/phrase. Data is heavily sampled.   allinanchor:   allinanchor: tesla announcements  Find pages with all individual terms after \"inanchor:\" in the inbound anchor text.   \\nNote that, for all of the \"allin...:\" operators, Google will try to apply the operator to every term following it. Combining \"allin...:\" operators with any other operators will almost never produce the desired results.\\nSearch operator tips &amp; tricks\\nHaving all of the pieces is only the first step in building a puzzle. The real power of search operators comes from combining them.\\n1. Chain together operator combos\\nYou can chain together almost any combination of text searches, basic operators, and advanced operators:\\n\"nikola tesla\" intitle:\"top 5..10 facts\" -site:youtube.com inurl:2015\\nThis search returns any pages that mention \"Nikola Tesla\" (exact-match), have the phrase \"Top (X) facts\" in the title, where X ranges from 5 to 10, are not on YouTube.com, and have \"2015\" somewhere in the URL.\\n2. Hunt down plagiarized content\\nTrying to find out if your content is unique or if someone is plagiarizing you? Use a unique phrase from your text, put it in quotes (exact-match) after an \"intext:\" operator, and exclude your own site with \"-site:\"...\\nintext:\"they were frolicking in our entrails\" -site:moz.com\\nSimilarly, you can use \"intitle:\" with a long, exact-match phrase to find duplicate copies of your content.\\n3. Audit your HTTP-&gt;HTTPS transition\\nSwitching a site from HTTP to HTTPS can be challenging. Double-check your progress by seeing how many of each type of page Google has indexed. Use the \"site:\" operator on your root domain and then exclude HTTPS pages with \"-inurl:\"...\\nsite:moz.com -inurl:https\\nThis will help you track down any stragglers or find pages that might not have been re-crawled by Google.\\nThese are just a few examples of a nearly infinite set of combinations. Looking for more examples? You\\'re in luck! We\\'ve created a mega-list of 67 examples to catapult you toward site operator mastery.\\nRise in the rankings with Moz Pro\\nWith top-notch link and keyword data and in-depth analytics, Moz Pro provides the tracking and insights you need to reach #1.

This ultimate guide contains all of Google\\'s search string parameters. you can also build your own advanced search using google\\'s advanced search form.\\nhttp://www.google.com/search?\\nGoogle\\'s URL. You\\'ll see it if you look at the address bar, or Chrome omnibar.\\nq=query+goes+here\\nThe query string. Words are separated by + signs.\\nEverything from here on in is preceded by an &amp; sign, as it\\'s tagged on to the end. Here\\'s where things get interesting...\\n 1. Exact match query \\nas_epq=query+goes+here\\nResults must include the query, in the word order displayed.\\n Shows as \"query goes here\" \\n    2. Advanced \"Or\" filter  \\nas_oq=\"query+string\"+goes+here\\nResults must include one or more of the words in this string. \\nBasically, it\\'s like a more advanced version of the one above, using an \"or\" filter. Thus, every result must have the main initial query, and one or more of the sets of terms in these strings.\\n Shows as \"query string\" OR goes OR here     3. Negative Keywords  \\nas_eq=don\\'t+include+these+words\\nResults must NOT include any words in this string.\\n Shows as -don\\'t -include -these -words \\n 4. Limit the number of results  \\nnum=xx\\nControls the number of results shown. \\nMust be a numeric value, and can be anything up to 100. Doesn\\'t work with fractions.\\n 5. Filetype match \\nas_filetype=extension\\nOnly returns results that end in .extension. Currently supports any input. Try it - make a file with a random extension, get it indexed and do a search. Also shows that as long as it validates to something.\\n Shows as filetype:extension \\n 6. Limit results to one site  \\nas_sitesearch=example.com\\nLimits results to just the site you choose.\\n Shows as site:example.com \\n 7. Find results from specific dates   \\nas_qdr=x\\nSwap out x for the following to limit the search to only files first indexed in:\\n d - the previous 24 hours w - the previous seven days m - the previous month y - past year mn - the previous n number of months. So m2 would be the previous two, m3 would be three, and so on. Does work into double digits \\n 8. Find pages with specific usage rights \\nas_rights=xxx\\nLimits the search to files/pages that have certain rights. The options are:\\n (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use or share (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_nonderived).-(cc_noncommercial) - free to use or share, including commercially (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial).-(cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike).-(cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify commercially \\nIf you want to make up your own, put the bits you want in brackets, separated by pipe characters (|), and exclude the bits you don\\'t by putting them in brackets, preceded by .- and again pipe-separated.\\n 9. Do an allintitle search as a query string \\nallintitle%3Asearch+terms\\nThis is actually appended to the q= parameter, hence a search for fishing with the allintitle term \"sea bass\" would require the following query:\\nq=fishing+allintitle%3Asea+bass\\n Shows as allintitle:search terms \\nN.B. This also works with allintext to search page body text, allinurl for searching the URL, and allinanchor for finding sites that are linked to with certain anchor text.   \\n 10. Find products in a specific price range \\nnnn..yyyy\\nLike the allin parameters, this is actually appended to the q= parameter. What this does though is let you search for results between numeric ranges. For example, if you wanted to find documents with numbers between 15 and 100, you\\'d put in 15..100. Very useful for finding products in a price range, when combined with the site limiter. Works with $, £, and other such things.\\n Shows as query 15..100 \\n 11. Do + searches as a query string  \\n%2Bterm\\nAgain, this is appended to the q= parameter. The %2B is actually the + sign encoded, and will return results featuring only the term used, with no pluralisations, alternate tenses, or synonyms.\\n Shows as +term \\n        12. Find results for your search term, and synonyms    \\n~term\\nAnother one that\\'s appended to the q= parameter. Returns results for the term used and synonyms.\\n Shows as ~term \\n      13. Find definitions for your search term    \\ndefine%3Aword\\nYet another q= parameter add-on. Returns definitions for the word you put in.\\n Shows as define:word \\n 14. Find results for two words that can have other words in between  \\nterm * term two\\nAnd another q= parameter add-on. Returns results with listings that contain both words, with other words between them.\\n 15. Use Google\\'s calculator via query string \\nn+n2, n-n2, n/n2, n*n2, n^n2 and n% of n2\\nGoogle\\'s calculator functions. They are, in order, add, subtract, divide, multiply, raise to the power of, and return x percentage of.\\n 16. Modify safe search \\nsafe=active\\nSets safe search to on. To turn it off, change active to images.\\n 17. Find similar sites \\nas_rq=example.com\\nFinds sites Google thinks are related to the URL you put in.\\n Shows as query related:example.com \\n   18. View a site\\'s backlinks  \\nas_lq=example.com\\nFinds sites that link to the URL you put in.\\n Shows as query link:example.com \\n 19. Open a new window  \\nnewwindow=n\\nOpens clicked listings in a new window. Very useful for opening lots of documents at a time, for competitor research. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\\n 20  . Modify personalized search  \\npws\\nControls whether personalised search is on or not. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\\n 21 . Stop Adwords from collecting data \\nadtest=on\\nTurns off AdWords database connection, so your browsing won\\'t show up as an impression, and will disable the URLs. Set to on to activate, and off to turn it off.\\n 22 . Simulate a button click \\nbtnG=Search\\nSimulates a click on the normal Google results buttom. Change to btnI to get the I\\'m Feeling Lucky button result.\\n 23 . Change input encoding settings \\nie=\\nControls the input encoding settings. This defaults to UTF-8, and is worked out server-side, hence changing it doesn\\'t do anything.\\n 24 . Change output encoding settings \\noe=\\nControls the output encoding settings. Works in the same way as ie, so you can tinker away, but it won\\'t do anything.\\n 25 . Change language \\n&amp;hl=value\\nChanges the interface language. I won\\'t list them all here, but you can find them all here. \\n 26 . Limit languages \\nlr=value\\nLimits the languages used to return results. Not hugely effective. That said, here\\'s the list of all of them:\\n lang_ar - Arabic lang_hy - Armenian lang_be - Belarusian lang_bg - Bulgarian lang_ca - Catalan lang_hr - Croatian lang_cs - Czech lang_da - Danish lang_nl - Dutch lang_en - English lang_eo - Esperanto lang_et - Estonian lang_tl - Filipino lang_fi - Finnish lang_fr - French lang_de - German lang_el - Greek lang_iw - Hebrew lang_hu - Hungarian lang_is - Icelandic lang_id - Indonesian lang_it - Italian lang_ja - Japanese lang_ko - Korean lang_lv - Latvian lang_lt - Lithuanian lang_no - Norwegian lang_fa - Persian lang_pl - Polish lang_pt - Portuguese lang_ro - Romanian lang_ru - Russian lang_sr - Serbian lang_sk - Slovak lang_sl - Slovenian lang_es - Spanish lang_sv - Swedish lang_th - Thai lang_tr - Turkish lang_uk - Ukrainian lang_vi - Vietnamese lang_zh-CN - Chinese Simplified lang_zh-TW - Chinese Traditional \\n 27 . Only view pages from certain locations \\ncr=countryXX\\nLimits the search results to pages/sites from certain locations. Change XX to any of the following, to limit the results:\\n AF - Afghanistan AL - Albania DZ - Algeria AS - American Samoa AD - Andorra AO - Angola AI - Anguilla AQ - Antarctica AG - Antigua and Barbuda AR - Argentina AM - Armenia AW - Aruba AU - Australia AT - Austria AZ - Azerbaijan BS - Bahamas BH - Bahrain BD - Bangladesh BB - Barbados BY - Belarus BE - Belgium BZ - Belize BJ - Benin BM - Bermuda BT - Bhutan BO - Bolivia BA - Bosnia and Herzegovina BW - Botswana BV - Bouvet Island BR - Brazil IO - British Indian Ocean Territory VG - British Virgin Islands BN - Brunei BG - Bulgaria BF - Burkina Faso BI - Burundi KH - Cambodia CM - Cameroon CA - Canada CV - Cape Verde KY - Cayman Islands CF - Central African Republic TD - Chad CL - Chile CN - China CX - Christmas Island CC - Cocos (Keeling) Islands CO - Colombia KM - Comoros CG - Congo - Brazzaville CD - Congo - Kinshasa CK - Cook Islands CR - Costa Rica CI - Cote d\\'Ivoire HR - Croatia CU - Cuba CY - Cyprus CZ - Czech Republic DK - Denmark DJ - Djibouti DM - Dominica DO - Dominican Republic EC - Ecuador EG - Egypt SV - El Salvador GQ - Equatorial Guinea ER - Eritrea EE - Estonia SZ - Eswatini ET - Ethiopia FK - Falkland Islands (Malvinas) FO - Faroe Islands FJ - Fiji FI - Finland FR - France GF - French Guiana PF - French Polynesia TF - French Southern Territories GA - Gabon GM - Gambia GE - Georgia DE - Germany GH - Ghana GI - Gibraltar GR - Greece GL - Greenland GD - Grenada GP - Guadeloupe GU - Guam GT - Guatemala GN - Guinea GW - Guinea-Bissau GY - Guyana HT - Haiti HM - Heard and McDonald Islands VA - Holy Sea HN - Honduras HK - Hong Kong HU - Hungary IS - Iceland IN - India ID - Indonesia IQ - Iraq IE - Ireland IL - Israel IT - Italy JM - Jamaica JP - Japan JO - Jordan KZ - Kazakhstan KE - Kenya KI - Kiribati KP - Korea, Democratic People\\'s Republic of KR - Korea, Republic of KW - Kuwait KG - Kyrgyzstan LA - Lao People\\'s Democratic Republic LV - Latvia LB - Lebanon LS - Lesotho LR - Liberia LY - Libyan Arab Jamahiriya LI - Liechtenstein LT - Lithuania LU - Luxembourg MO - Macau MK - Macedonia MG - Madagascar MW - Malawi MY - Malaysia MV - Maldives ML - Mali MT - Malta MH - Marshall Islands MQ - Martinique MR - Mauritania MU - Mauritius YT - Mayotte MX - Mexico FM - Micronesia, Federated States of MD - Moldova, Republic of MC - Monaco MN - Mongolia MS - Montserrat MA - Morocco MZ - Mozambique MM - Myanmar NA - Namibia NR - Nauru NP - Nepal NL - Netherlands AN - Netherlands Antilles NC - New Caledonia NZ - New Zealand NI - Nicaragua NE - Niger NG - Nigeria NU - Niue NF - Norfolk Island MP - Northern Mariana Islands NO - Norway OM - Oman PK - Pakistan PW - Palau PS - Palestinian Territory PA - Panama PG - Papua New Guinea PY - Paraguay PE - Peru PH - Philippines PN - Pitcairn PL - Poland PT - Portugal PR - Puerto Rico QA - Qatar RE - Reunion RO - Romania RU - Russian Federation RW - Rwanda SH - Saint Helena KN - Saint Kitts and Nevis LC - Saint Lucia PM - Saint Pierre &amp; Miquelon VC - Saint Vincent and the Grenadines WS - Samoa SM - San Marino ST - Sao Tome and Principe SA - Saudi Arabia SN - Senegal CS - Serbia and Montenegro SC - Seychelles SL - Sierra Leone SG - Singapore SK - Slovakia SI - Slovenia SB - Solomon Islands SO - Somalia ZA - South Africa GS - South Georgia and The South Sandwich Islands ES - Spain LK - Sri Lanka SD - Sudan SR - Suriname SJ - Svalbard &amp; Jan Mayen SE - Sweden CH - Switzerland SY - Syrian Arab Republic TW - Taiwan TJ - Tajikistan TZ - Tanzania TH - Thailand TL - Timor-Leste TG - Togo TK - Tokelau TO - Tonga TT - Trinidad and Tobago TN - Tunisia TR - Turkey TM - Turkmenistan TC - Turks and Caicos Islands TV - Tuvalu UG - Uganda UA - Ukraine AE - United Arab Emirates GB - United Kingdom US - United States UM - United States Minor Outlying Islands UY - Uruguay UZ - Uzbekistan VU - Vanuatu VE - Venezuela VN - Viet Nam VG - Virgin Islands (British) VI - Virgin Islands (U.S.) WF - Wallis and Futuna Islands EH - Western Sahara YE - Yemen ZM - Zambia ZW - Zimbabwe \\nKeep learning\\n  Mastering Google Search Operators in 67 Easy Steps   SEO Essentials Certification   Beginner\\'s Guide to SEO: How Search Engines Work: Crawling, Indexing, and Ranking   \\n \\nPut your skills to work\\nGauge a Site\\'s Influence with Link Explorer\\nLink Explorer is a link popularity and backlink analysis tool that lets you research and compare any site on the web.'], market_size=0, growth_potential=0.0, key_characteristics=[])],\n",
